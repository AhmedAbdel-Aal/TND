      " Title: \"Unfair Trial Due to Lack of Right to Examine Anonymous Witness: Forostyan v. Russia\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The case involves a complaint made by Mr. Forostyank against Russia, alleging an unfair trial due to restrictions on the right to examine an anonymous witness during criminal proceedings. This violation of Article 6+6-3-d (Right to a fair trial, specifically the Examination of witnesses) was found in accordance with the European Court of Human Rights' established case law regarding prosecution witnesses who did not attend the trial and had their previous statements admitted as evidence. The Court concluded that the applicant was not provided an opportunity to cross-examine this witness, and no effort was made by the national judicial authorities to compensate for these difficulties. As a result, it was determined that there was a breach of Article 6 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importance Level: 2 - Moderately Important - While this case does not have a significant impact on overall legal policy or numerous parties, it serves as an important reminder of established case law regarding the right to a fair trial and the importance of allowing the accused to cross-examine witnesses. This case could potentially influence similar cases in the future or serve as a precedent for other courts dealing with similar issues.\n",

    "\"procedure\": \"1. The case originated in an application against Russia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( the Convention ) on 28 November 2018.\\n2. The applicant was represented by Mr Y. Pyatitskiy, a lawyer practising in Rostov-on-Don.\\n3. The Russian Government ( the Government ) were given notice of the application.\",\n",
    "\"facts\": \"4. The applicant s details and information relevant to the application are set out in the appended table.\\n5. The applicant complained of the unfair trial in view of restrictions on the right to examine a witness.\",\n",
    "\"law\": \"ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention\\n6. The applicant complained of the unfair trial in view of restrictions on the right to examine an anonymous witness for prosecution. He relied, expressly or in substance, on Article 6 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\\nArticle 6 1 and 3 (d)\\nIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\\n...\\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights ...\\n...\\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him ...\\n7. The general principles to be applied in cases where a prosecution witness did not attend the trial and his statements previously made by him were admitted as evidence are well-established in the Court s case law (see Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, 100-31, ECHR 2015). In Schatschaschwili, the Court found a violation on account of the authorities failure to provide the applicant with an opportunity to have the two key prosecution witnesses examined at any stage of the proceedings (ibid., 161-65).\\n. Turning to the circumstances of the present case and having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion on the admissibility and merits of these complaints. Even leaving open the question as to whether there were good reasons for the non-attendance of the key witness, it considers that the fact that the applicant was not provided with an opportunity to cross-examine the witness, who had also been anonymised, weighs heavily in the balance in the examination of the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against him. The Court also takes into account that there is nothing in the materials in its possession to suggest that there was any effort on the part of the national judicial authorities to make use of any counterbalancing measures to compensate for the difficulties experienced by the applicant on account of the admission of the untested statements by the witness as evidence.\\n9. These complaints are therefore admissible and disclose a breach of Article 6 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.\\nAPPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\\n10. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\\nIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\\n11. Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its caselaw (see, in particular, Zadumov v. Russia, no. 2257/12, 81, 12 December 2017), the Court considers that the finding of a violation constitutes a sufficient just satisfaction in the present case.\",\n",
    "\"conclusion\": \"Declares the application admissible;\\nHolds that this application discloses a breach of Article 6 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention concerning the unfair trial in view of restrictions on the right to examine an anonymous witness;\\nHolds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction\\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 27 October 2022, pursuant to Rule 77 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\\n\"\n",
