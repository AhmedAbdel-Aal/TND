The applicant alleged that his husband was killed by the Turkish security forces or with their complicity. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) examined whether there was a violation of Articles 2, 6-1, and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ECtHR held that there was insufficient evidence to show that the applicant's husband was killed by the security forces or with their complicity, and thus, no violation of Article 2 was found on this ground. The Court also held that the investigation into the applicant's husband's death was not satisfactory, as it was incomplete, superficial, and late, and did not comply with the procedural requirements arising under Article 2 of the Convention. The Court concluded that there had been no violation of Article 2 in this regard.\n",

      "In the case of Sabuktekin v. Turkey, decided on 19/03/2002, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) examined the complaint of a Turkish citizen, Mrs. Sabuktekin, regarding the death of her husband and the investigation that followed. The Court found no violation of Articles 2, 6-1, and 13 of the European Convention of Human Rights, but it did find a violation of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 2.\n",

      "1. The applicant's husband was killed on 28 September 1994. The investigation into his death was launched immediately, but the police questioned only four people at the scene. An autopsy or toxicological analysis was not carried out, and relevant evidence was not collected in a timely manner.\n",

      "2. In July 1995, an operation was launched against Hizbullah, and fourteen people were arrested. The investigation focused on these suspects, but only two of them were questioned. The investigation did not yield any results, and the authorities did not hear evidence from key witnesses until 1998.\n",

      "3. The ECHR concluded that, while the investigation was long and complex, it was incomplete, superficial, and too late to provide any prospect of solving the murder. The Court found that the investigation did not comply with the procedural requirements arising under Article 2 of the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. However, the ECHR did not find a violation of Article 2 concerning the effectiveness of the investigation, as the authorities had taken numerous steps to investigate the death and had made efforts to identify and question suspects.\n",

      "5. The ECHR also found that it was not necessary to examine the applicant's complaint under Article 6-1 of the Convention.\n",
      "\n",

      "In conclusion, the Sabuktekin v. Turkey case involved a long and complex investigation into the death of the applicant's husband.
