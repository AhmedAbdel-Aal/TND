      "THE LOCUS STANDI OF Ms Olena Oleksandrivna Kruhlova\n",
      "6. As concerns the complaints raised by the applicant in application no. 25946/19, the Court notes that the applicant died on 20 May 2020 while the case was pending before the Court. The applicant s wife, Ms Olena Oleksandrivna Kruhlova, has requested to pursue the application in her husband s stead. As the request is in line with its case-law, the Court sees no reason to refuse it (see, among other authorities, Benyaminson v. Ukraine, no. 31585/02, 83, 26 July 2007, and Horv thov v. Slovakia, no. 74456/01, 25-27, 17 May 2005). However, reference will still be made to the applicant throughout the present text.\n",
      "ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 1 AND ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "7. The applicants complained that the length of the criminal proceedings in question had been incompatible with the reasonable time requirement and that they had no effective remedy in this connection. They relied on Article 6 1 and Article 13 of the Convention.\n",
      "8. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicants and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicants in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, P lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, 67, ECHR 1999II, and Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, 43, ECHR 2000VII).\n",
      "9. In the leading case of Nechay v. Ukraine, no. 15360/10, 1 July 2021 the Court already found a violation in respect of issues similar to those in the present case.\n",
      "10. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of justifying the overall length of the proceedings at the national level. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement.\n",
      "11. The Court further notes that the applicants did not have at their disposal an effective remedy in respect of these complaints.\n",
      "12. These complaints are therefore admissible and disclose a breach of Article 6 1 and of Article 13 of the Convention.\n",

      "            I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n",
      "9. The applicant, an Austrian citizen born in 1918, lives in where he practises the profession of accountant and financial consultant (Wirtschaftspr fer und Steuerberater).\n",
      "10. On 15 July 1977, an 85-year-old woman, Mrs. Irmgard Proxauf, acting through a lawyer, reported to the Innsbruck public prosecutor's office that three days earlier during a quarrel Mr. Adolf had thrown at another person, Mrs. Anneliese Schuh, a bunch of keys which had then struck her (Mrs. Proxauf), causing her injury. In her letter headed \"request to inquire into a set of facts\", she called on the prosecutor's office to take criminal proceedings against the applicant and stated that she would be a civil party claiming damages in any such proceedings (Privatbeteiligte).\n",
      "11. The federal police at , instructed on 12 August by the public prosecutor's office to investigate whether or not a punishable act had been committed, interrogated several persons cited by Mrs. Proxauf at witnesses and, on 22 September, the applicant himself. He denied the facts alleged against him and denounced the complaint as being knowingly false. After pointing out that the object alleged to have caused the injury was, in fact, an envelope containing a single key, he asserted, amongst other things, that he had not thrown it: he had wanted to give it back to Mrs. Proxauf, but it had slipped out of his hand and touched her arm. Mrs. Schuh, he said, had picked it up and thrown it, just above his head, over a distance of thirteen metres in the direction of his house. Mr. Adolf's wife and two employees had written a note setting out what they remembered of the incident. This note, he stated was available to the court, as an item for inclusion in the case-file. The police accepted the note, but did not question Mrs. Adolf or the employees.\n",
      "On 28 September, the public prosecutor's office, to which the file had been returned, asked the Innsbruck District Court (Bezirksgericht) to procure a medical report on the seriousness of Mrs. Proxauf's injury. The Court registered the case on 4 October 1977; under the heading \"punishable act\" it specified \"section 83 of the Penal Code\", which is a provision, amongst others, dealing with the infliction of bodily harm.\n",
      "Following receipt of the doctor's opinion, the District Court assessed the costs of that opinion on 11 November 1977. The district prosecutor (Bezirksanwalt) requested the District Court on 21 November to \"decide that the conditions of section 42 of the Penal Code [were] fulfilled\" (see paragraph 22 below). The Court acceded to the request on 24 November by inserting in the file a note worded as follows: \"B\" (Beschluss, decision): \"... the proceedings are closed pursuant to section 451 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\"; in addition, it added to the register, under the heading \"date and manner ... of disposal of the matter\" (Erledigung): \"24. 11. Section 451 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\".\n",
      "12. On 3 December, an application was made to the District Court by Mr. Adolf who, after consultation of the file on his case, had come to learn on 22 November of the submissions made by the public prosecutor's office on the previous day; however, like that office, he was not aware of the decision of 24 November. He denied that he had injured Mrs. Proxauf, whether by throwing a bunch of keys or otherwise, and contested the doctor's findings, claiming in particular that the latter had based his opinion on information that was contradicted by the material in the case-file (aktenwidrig). He called on the District Court either to acquit him after trial or to terminate the proceedings pursuant to section 90 par. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 21 below). He requested that, if the District Court should choose the first alternative, fresh medical evidence be taken forthwith.\n",
      "On 22 December, the District Court notified an associate of the applicant's lawyer that the proceedings had been terminated - on an unspecified date - in pursuance of section 451 2 the Code of Criminal Procedure. Following a request made by Mr. Adolf on 4 January 1978, the Court served on him on 24 January a decision dated 10 January which reads as follows (translation from German):\n",
      "\"Decision\n",
      "In the criminal case (Strafsache) against Dr. Gustav Adolf for the offence of inflicting bodily harm, within the meaning of section 83 of the Penal Code, the District Court of Innsbruck has decided as follows upon the request of the public prosecutor:\n",
      "The conditions of section 42 of the Penal Code are met; the proceedings are terminated in accordance with section 451 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n",
      "Reasons\n",
      "By letter of 15 July 1977, the civil party Irma Proxauf informed the public prosecutor of an incident involving herself and the accused (Beschuldigter) which had happened on 12 July 1977. She alleged that the accused had caused her an injury, namely a bruise on her left arm and another below her left breast, with a bunch of keys. The investigations made thereupon and the expert opinion have shown (ergeben) that in the course of a quarrel the accused flew into a rage and threw an envelope containing a key in the direction of Mrs. Anneliese Schuh who however managed to avoid the missile, while the 85-year-old Irma Proxauf standing behind her was hit. The key first struck the back of the right hand, causing a superficial abrasion, and then bounced against the left side of the above-named person's chest. No injury could be established on the chest.\n",
      "The injury found (festgestellte) is insignificant (geringf gig) as it does not exceed the three-day limit; the fault (Verschulden) of the accused may be described as insignificant (geringf gig), and his character gives cause to expect that he will conduct himself properly in future.\n",
      "Therefore the conditions of section 42 of the Penal Code are met, justifying the above decision.\n",
      "District Court of , Section 9, 10 January 1978.\"\n",
      "13. The applicant challenged this decision before the (Landesgericht) of which, on 23 February 1978, declared the appeal (Beschwerde) inadmissible on the ground that section 451 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure limited the right of appeal to the prosecutor (Ankl ger).\n",
      "14. On 25 January 1980, a little more than six months after the European Commission of Human Rights had accepted the application, the Generalprokurator (the public prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) filed, with the Supreme Court, pursuant to section 33 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an application for annulment of the decision dated 10 January 1978 in the interests of the proper application of the law (Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes).\n",
      "The Generalprokurator drew a distinction between the termination of proceedings by virtue of section 451 par. 2 and their termination by virtue of section 90 par. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The former provision applied when, prior to the trial hearing, the court was satisfied that the conditions of section 42 of the Penal Code were met; where, however, no sufficient grounds existed for continuing with the prosecution, the public prosecutor should close the file (zur cklegen) on the complaint and the investigating judge should bring the proceeding to an end in accordance with the general rules laid down in section 90 par. 1 and 447 par. 1. In both cases, he said, the decisions would be taken without the formal hearing of evidence (Beweisverfahren), something which, as followed in any event from Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) being a provision that has constitutional status in Austrian law -, should in principle precede any finding of guilt (Schulderkenntnis).\n",
      "Thus, in the submission of the Generalprokurator, section 42 of the Penal Code was not appropriate where, on the basis of the complaint or the preliminary enquiries, no offence could be established on the facts or existed in law. On the other hand, for section 42 to apply it was not essential for there to be proof of guilt, but merely a suspicion (Tatverdacht) such as would warrant the opening of preliminary enquiries or an application seeking the imposition of a penalty. A court decision terminating proceedings in accordance with section 42 could therefore only be grounded on a \"suspected state of affairs\" (Verdachtslage) as disclosed by the case-file: the court had to limit itself to ascertaining whether there existed against the suspect sufficient suspicion for proceeding with the prosecution and whether, on the hypothetical assumption that the suspect had indeed committed the alleged offence, he was or was not entitled to benefit from the ground for exoneration (Strafausschliessungsgrund) provided for under section 42 of the Penal Code. It seemed inadmissible to state in the reasons for such a decision conclusions on the objective and subjective aspects of the act and to take it as proved against the suspect that he had engaged in a certain course of conduct constituting a punishable act. Such an assertion in the reasons for a decision terminating proceedings amounted to a finding of guilt without any formal taking of evidence at a public hearing, which would be in violation of Article 6 par. 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention.\n",
      "In the instant case, said the Generalprokurator, the District Court had clearly indicated that it accepted the account of the incident given by Mrs. Proxauf and corroborated by the police investigations and by the medical evidence, and that it disbelieved the applicant's denials which were mainly concerned with what had happened during the incident (Tathergang). He submitted that as the decision in issue was not capable of causing Mr. Adolf any direct prejudice, a finding that it had infringed the law would be sufficient. The Generalprokurator therefore moved the Supreme Court to hold that the Innsbruck District Court's decision dated 10 January 1978 was, as regards its reasoning, contrary to the law, that is to say section 451 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read in conjunction with Article 6 par. 1 and 2 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2) of the Convention.\n",
      "15. On 24 February 1980, Mr. Adolf submitted to the Supreme Court certain observations on the application for annulment. Whilst welcoming the initiative taken by the Generalprokurator, he considered that the latter had disregarded essential elements of violation of the law inherent in the impugned decision. In particular, he disputed the interpretation given by the Generalprokurator to section 42 of the Penal Code; in the applicant's view, this section in fact required the court to make a positive finding of an act fulfilling the description of a criminal offence. He relied on section 451 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which places the judge under a duty to satisfy himself, before bringing the proceedings to a close, that the conditions stipulated under section 42 of the Penal Code are met; in order to do this, so the applicant contended, the judge must have regard to all the evidence adduced and not simply to the evidence supporting the suspicion.\n",
      "Mr. Adolf criticised the District Court for having failed to take into consideration evidence in his favour, for having declined to hear witnesses requested by him and for not having given him the opportunity to challenge the expert medical opinion; he alleged a breach of Article 6 par. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) of the Convention. He accordingly called on the Supreme Court to find infringements of the law other than those pleaded by the Generalprokurator and to order that the proceedings be terminated under section 451 par. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n",
      "16. The Supreme Court rejected the application for annulment on 28 February 1980.\n",
      "In the opinion of the Supreme Court, the application of section 42 par. 1 of the Penal Code did not place the suspect in a worse position than where the case is closed for some other reason (for example, in pursuance of section 90 par. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), that is to say, a closure of the case which, in general, does not involve establishing the innocence of the person concerned. Section 42 is not at all meant to be used to terminate proceedings when it is certain that an offence cannot be proved on the facts or does not exist in law. On the other hand, section 42 does not demand verification of the objective and subjective elements of the offence; indeed, this would be contrary to the main object of the section, namely procedural economy (Prozess konomie - the principle that the court's time should be usefully employed). The person concerned thus has no right to have doubtful issues in the case clarified.\n",
      "Section 42 simply requires the existence of a suspicion. Even if a court describes the suspect's conduct in terms of findings of fact, any statements to this effect could not be regarded as judicial findings (Konstatierungen), within the meaning of section 270 par. 2, no. 5, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the attendant legal consequences. In point of fact, by reason of its basic legal character, any decision taken in pursuance of section 42 of the Penal Code can only be understood in one way: further clarification of, and possible prosecution in, a case which is already recognisable as being a trifling matter is to be avoided, not least in the interests of procedural economy. Howsoever the reasons given therefore may be worded, any such decision contains - if only because of its very nature - a negative ruling on the merits of the case and does not at all amount to a declaration, equivalent to a finding of guilt, that the suspect has (unlawfully and with criminal intent) committed a punishable act.\n",
      "It would certainly have been preferable had the Innsbruck District Court stated this explicitly and without ambiguity in the decision being challenged. Nonetheless, the more or less apposite choice of wording in the reasoning could not deprive the reasoning of the specific significance it had as a result of the nature of the decision given and could not, therefore, in any way adversely affect the person concerned.\n",
      "Since legal proof of the suspect's guilt is not the object pursued under section 42 of the Penal Code, no question arises as to the extent to which a decision given in pursuance of this provision has or has not been preceded by proceedings complying with the requirements of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n",
      "17. The judgment of the Supreme Court was reproduced in an Austrian legal journal but the applicant's identity was not revealed. The accompanying commentary on the judgment referred to an article entitled \"A trivial affair leads to an application against \" (\"Aus Bagatellsache wurde Klage gegen sterreich\"), which had been published in a newspaper in May 1980 and which did disclose his name, profession and place of residence.\n",
      "The professional association to which Mr. Adolf belongs has not instituted any disciplinary proceedings against him in respect of the facts underlying Mrs. Proxauf's complaint.\n",
      "According to Mr. Adolf, the file on his case, including the Innsbruck District Court's decision dated 10 January 1978, has been produced in evidence in a civil action between himself and Mrs. Proxauf in the matter of an easement (Dienstbarkeit); an order issued by the competent civil court in took the case-file into consideration.\n",
      "18. The costs of the procedure, and notably the costs of the medical opinion, were borne by the State. The applicant himself had to pay his lawyer's fees and his own expenses.\n",
      "II. THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION\n",
      "19. In , the public prosecutor (Staatsanwalt) is required by law to inquire into the correctness of any report (Anzeige) of an offence for which a prosecution must be brought as a matter of course (section 87 par. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). He is obliged, as a matter of course, to prosecute in respect of any offence which appears to him to have been committed and where it is not a precondition of investigation and punishment that an application be made by the victim or some other person concerned; it is his duty to cause the competent court to take the necessary measures of investigation and punishment (section 34 par. 1).\n",
      "In order to procure the necessary evidence for the institution of criminal proceedings or for the closing of the file (Zur cklegung) on a complaint, the public prosecutor may have preliminary enquiries (Vorerhebungen) carried out by the investigating judge, the district courts and the police authorities (section 88 par. 1).\n",
      "20. Where the public prosecutor is satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for bringing a criminal prosecution, he shall either apply for the institution of a preliminary investigation (Voruntersuchung) or file a formal accusation (Anklageschrift, section 90 par. 1). However, in district court proceedings there is no formal process of investigation and no special procedure of accusation: all that is required is a written or oral application from the district prosecutor seeking the imposition of a penalty on the person concerned (Antrag auf gesetzliche Bestrafung, section 451 par. 1).\n",
      "21. Where sufficient grounds for prosecuting the individual in question are lacking, the public prosecutor shall take no further action on the complaint and shall transmit the file to the investigating judge, together with a statement to the effect that he sees no reason to continue with the prosecution; the judge must then terminate the preliminary enquiries (section 90 par. 1). This provision applies, mutatis mutandis, to district court proceedings (section 447 par. 1).\n",
      "Under the terms of section 90 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the public prosecutor may alternatively ask the investigating judge to hold that the conditions of section 42 of the Penal Code are met. In cases before a district court, the decision terminating proceedings is governed by section 451 par. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides (translation from German):\n",
      "\"If the court is satisfied that the conditions laid down in section 42 are met, it shall terminate the proceedings by a decision. The public prosecutor may lodge an appeal against any such decision ...\"\n",
      "22. Section 42 of the Penal Code reads as follows (translation from German):\n",
      "\"(1) Where an act requiring public prosecution as a matter of course involves liability to no more than a fine, a custodial sentence not exceeding one year or both, the act shall not be punishable (strafbar) if\n",
      "(2) The decision whether or not the conditions of paragraph (1) hereof are met shall be taken by the court; where the court decides in the affirmative, it shall bring the proceedings to a close no matter what stage they may have reached.\"\n",
      "Section 42 was introduced into the new Austrian Penal Code which entered into force on 1 January 1975, and is aimed at avoiding criminal trials in trivial cases, notably for reasons of procedural economy; the section is headed \"acts not meriting punishment\" (\"mangelnde Strafw rdigkeit der Tat\"). The Supreme Court and the great majority of legal commentators regard it as a clause which is not concerned with mere procedure but which provides a substantive ground for exonerating the accused (sachlicher Strafausschliessungsgrund).\n",
      "23. A decision taken by a court in pursuance of section 42 to terminate proceedings is not entered in the criminal record of the person concerned. The file relating to a case closed in this manner may be used in other legal (and disciplinary) proceedings, as may, in principle, the case-file in any legal action whatever its outcome.\n",
      "According to Mr. Adolf, anyone may go to the court and consult the register of cases and the register of names and, at least as far as the former is concerned, ask for an extract. The Government contested these assertions, save apparently as regards the possibility of having access to the register of names. The latter simply contains a reference to the register of cases without giving any indication as to the nature of the litigation.\n",
      "24. As a result of the present case, two circulars were issued on 15 January 1979 and 24 March 1980 by the relevant Austrian authorities drawing the attention of the courts to the problems raised by the application of section 42 of the Penal Code and to the need for a careful wording of the relevant decisions (see paragraphs 33 and 34 of the report of the Commission).25. In his application of 7 June 1978 to the Commission (no. 8269/78), Mr. Adolf complained of the Innsbruck District Court's decision dated 10 January 1978. He claimed that this decision was contrary to Article 6 par. 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention as it contained findings both on the facts of the alleged offence and on his guilt. In his submission, since such findings were required by the very terms of section 42 of the Penal Code, the legislation itself was inconsistent with Article 6 par. 2 (art. 6-2). He further alleged violation of the rights guaranteed by Article 6 par. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) in that, notwithstanding his denial of the accusations made against him and his request for the hearing of witnesses in his favour, the District Court took its decision without holding a trial hearing and without proper inquiry into the evidence.\n",
      "26. The Commission accepted the application on 6 July 1979.\n",
      "In its report of 8 October 1980 (Article 31 of the Convention) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been breach of paragraph 2 of Article 6 (art. 6-2) (nine votes to six, with one abstention), but no breach of paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (twelve votes to three, with one abstention).\n",
      "The report contains three dissenting opinions.\n",
      "            </FACTS>\n",
      "\n",
      "            <CONCLUSION_2>\n",
      "            1. Holds unanimously that Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention was applicable in the present case;\n",
      "2. Holds, by four votes to three, that there has been no breach of that Article (art. 6).\n",
      "Done in English and in French, the French text being authentic, at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, this twenty-sixth day of March, one thousand nine hundred and eighty-two.\n",
      "The following separate opinions are annexed to the present judgment in accordance with Article 51 par. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 50 par. 2 of the Rules of Court:\n",
      "- joint dissenting opinion of Mr. Cremona, Mr. Liesch and Mr. Pettiti;\n",
      "- concurring opinion of Mr. Matscher.\n",
      "We find ourselves unable to agree with the majority of our colleagues that there was no violation of the Convention in this case.\n",
      "We do go along with them as far as their conclusions that in 1977 the applicant was subjected to a criminal charge and that Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention is in fact applicable to this case. But then we cannot agree that the decision of the Austrian Supreme Court of 28 February 1980, so far as it went, contrived to set right a situation which was then already in violation of Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2), of the Convention. It is here at this crucial point that we are compelled to part ways with the majority.\n",
      "In its decision dated 10 January 1978 (\"Decision in the criminal case against Dr. Gustav Adolf for the offence of inflicting bodily harm, within the meaning of section 83 of the Penal Code\") the Innsbruck District Court, applying section 42 of the Penal Code, stated as follows:\n",
      "In our view this reasoning clearly amounts to a judicial finding, in the context of a criminal charge, that the applicant inflicted bodily harm on another person and that he was in a state of guilt in doing so. The net result is that, notwithstanding the applicant's persistent denial of the allegations made against him, and without holding a public trial, hearing any witnesses and giving the applicant the opportunity to challenge the aforesaid expert medical opinion, that Court made findings establishing both the disputed facts and his contested guilt.\n",
      "It is true that in its decision of 28 February 1980 the Austrian Supreme Court in effect stated that, notwithstanding the infelicitous wording used by the District Court in its decision, that decision, inasmuch as it applied section 42 of the Austrian Penal Code, was based solely on the existence of a \"suspected state of affairs\".\n",
      "But whilst it is clear that, in a case like this, in principle it is not within the province of our Court to review the correctness of the construction put upon section 42 of the Penal Code of Austria by the Austrian Supreme Court, it is equally clear that what was found by the District Court in unambiguous and unmistakable language cannot be made to mean other than what it obviously and unavoidably means. The \"fact\" of those findings was not erased by mere \"hypothetical\" whitewashing.\n",
      "Indeed the fact remains that the District Court's decision, the grounds of which in effect amounted to declaring the applicant guilty of a criminal offence, still stands. The Supreme Court did not set it aside and the construction put upon it in no way erased the positive findings actually made in it. Nor did that Court correct the failure of the District Court to respect the requirements of Article 6 1 and 2 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2) of the Convention taken together, which should have been observed before those findings were actually reached.\n",
      "Clearly, before a person is found guilty of a criminal offence it is essential that he should have the benefit of the guarantees of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. But the decision of the District Court, which as already stated still stands, was reached by a procedure under which the applicant did not have the opportunity to exercise his rights under that Article (art. 6), in particular his right to a fair and public hearing and his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\n",
      "We therefore find that there was a breach of Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2), of the Convention.\n",
      "In view of this conclusion, we feel dispensed from ascertaining whether there was, in addition, a breach of Article 6 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d).\n",
      "I voted for the conclusion that there had been no violation of Article 6 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention, primarily for the reasons given in the judgment.\n",
      "Nonetheless, I should like to point out that the same conclusion could be reached by other routes, for example by reliance on the nature of section 42 of the Austrian Penal Code, from which it follows that the district court, whenever it applies this section of the Penal Code, is deciding that the contested facts do not attain the level of seriousness of a criminal offence and thus fall completely outside the sphere of the criminal law; in other words, by applying this provision a district court can never violate Article 6 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention, which safeguards the presumption of innocence only in respect of a charge of a criminal offence.\n",
      "It could also be maintained that whilst the Innsbruck District Court did indeed make a finding of certain facts in the reasoning of its decision, it did so in such a generic manner that what it stated did not amount to finding proved all the various elements that must be proved for there to be a specific criminal offence.\n",
      "On the other hand, I well understand the way of thinking of my colleagues who have felt unable to concur with the majority. In point of fact, the present case is the result of a chain of unfortunate circumstances and of mishandling on the part of the relevant authorities, something which can make it difficult in the particular event to reach the conclusion that there was no breach of Article 6 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention.\n",
      "To begin with, section 42 of the Austrian Penal Code seems to me to be unsatisfactorily drafted. Read literally, it could be taken as suggesting that its application presupposes a finding of guilt, which would hardly be reconcilable with the presumption of innocence within the meaning of Article 6 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention (unless the argument based on the very nature of section 42 of the Penal Code be adopted; as to this, see above). The picture changes only if section 42 of the Penal Code is construed in the light of its drafting history, the corpus of the rules of criminal procedure and Article 6 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention (which has constitutional status in Austria).\n",
      "It is also understandable that, confronted with this text which, as is evident can be conducive to misunderstandings, the judge at Innsbruck should have resorted to what the Supreme Court called a \"more or less apposite choice of wording\" but what I, personally, would prefer to term as a choice of totally improper wording. It is precisely this factor that lies at the root of the present application.\n",
      "Furthermore, it was wrong of the District Court to have dated 10 January 1978 the written reasoning requested by the applicant, without specifying that as a matter of law the termination decision had been taken earlier on 24 November 1977.\n",
      "Finally, it would have been preferable had the Supreme Court taken advantage of the occasion offered to it by holding the reasoning of 10 January 1978 to be contrary to the law, as it had been moved to do by the Generalprokurator. Such a course of action was all the more open to the Supreme Court in view of the fact that section 292 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, fourth sentence, provides, inter alia, for judgment declaring that a \"manner of proceeding\" (Vorgang) was contrary to the law; and this, without any doubt, was what occurred in the present case.\n",
      "To sum up, notwithstanding the circumstances that I have just recounted, I consider the correct conclusion to be that there was no breach of Article 6 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention.\n",

The burden of proving that the interests of justice require legal assistance must not be laid upon the accused person. In the present case, there were no valid reasons for dispensing with legal assistance, and the Court concludes that the failure to grant legal aid for the appeal violated the applicants' right under Article 6 para. 3 (c) of the Convention.\n",

Therefore, the failure to grant legal assistance for the appeal also violated the applicants' right under Article 6 para. 3 (c) of the Convention.\n"

      "I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "17. The applicant complained that the conditions of his detention in remand prison IZ-77/3 of Moscow between 22 November 2008 and 7 September 2009 violated Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n",
      "No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n",
      "A. Admissibility\n",
      "18. With reference to various provisions of the Rules of Court and the Practice Direction on Institution of Proceedings, the Government alleged that the application form had been lodged after a long delay and that its date of posting, rather than that of the applicant s first letter, should be taken as the date of introduction of the case. In their view, that fact had an impact on the admissibility of the complaint, in particular as regards the six-month time-limit set by Article 35 1 of the Convention.\n",
      "19. The applicant did not comment.\n",
      "20. The Court observes that the application form was posted on 4 December 2009, that is within six months from 7 September 2009, when the applicant had left the remand prison, the starting date of the six-month time-limit. The Court concludes that even if it were to accept the Government s argument, the applicant s complaint is not out of time for the purposes of Article 35 1 of the Convention.\n",
      "21. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n",
      "B. Establishment of facts\n",
      "22. The applicant was held in the Moscow remand prison IZ-77/3 between 22 November 2008 and 7 September 2009, that is nine months and fifteen days.\n",
      "23. The Court observes that the Government submitted a large number of documents concerning various aspects of the applicant s detention. Of particular importance is the prison population register, an original document which was prepared during the period of the applicant s stay in the prison and covered a large part of the detention. The documents showed that the applicant had been detained in cells 608, 207, 517 and 510, which measured around 34, 32, 37 and 13 sq. m, respectively.\n",
      "24. The Court however notes that the documents, including the certificates by the director of the prison, the prison population register and the domestic judgments, variously indicated the number of sleeping places and the actual occupancy of the cells (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 11 above).\n",
      "25. Nevertheless, the Court finds that, even considering the highest occupancy figures, the applicant was afforded around 4 sq. m of personal space and that there was no shortage of sleeping places during the period under examination.\n",
      "26. As to the findings of the domestic authorities regarding the lack of personal space (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above), the Court observes that the prosecutor s reply referred to the remand prison in general, rather than to the applicant s personal situation, whereas the domestic judgment did not indicate the actual occupancy of the cells and it is not clear from it why such conclusion was reached.\n",
      "27. The applicant s submissions differed from those of the Government in every aspect save for the number of one cell. Although they were sufficiently detailed, the only evidence corroborating them were the cellmates statements, which contained general assertions without references to concrete details (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, the Court notes that the factual information provided by the Government was not contested by the applicant in his observations in reply. For these reasons, the Court lends credence to the Government s submissions.\n",
      "C. Compliance with Article 3\n",
      "28. The Court found it established that the applicant had been provided with around four square metres of floor surface and disposed of his own sleeping place. It cannot be said that the dimensions of his cells were so small as to restrict the applicant s freedom of movement (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, 143-148, 10 January 2012).\n",
      "29. It also appears that the applicant was allowed a one-hour outdoor exercise daily. Windows were not fitted with metal shutters preventing natural light and fresh air from penetrating into the cells. The cells were additionally equipped with artificial lighting and forced ventilation.\n",
      "30. The Court observes that the lavatory pans, the dining tables and the sleeping places were all located within the cells, but at a sufficient distance from each other. Brick partitions separated the toilets from the rest of the cells. Hot and cold running water was available to detainees and the applicant had regular access to shower and washing facilities.\n",
      "31. Taking into account the cumulative effect of those conditions, the Court considers that the conditions of the applicant s detention in remand prison IZ-77/3 of Moscow between 22 November 2008 and 7 September 2009 cannot be regarded as inhuman or degrading. There has been therefore no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n",
      "II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "32. The applicant further complained that he did not dispose of an effective domestic remedy for his grievance concerning the inhuman conditions of detention, as required by Article 13 of the Convention, which provides that:\n",
      "Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\n",
      "33. The Government, with reference to the Court s judgment of Ananyev and Others v. Russia (cited above) acknowledged the absence of such remedies, but submitted that the applicant was not a victim of the violation since he did not attempt to raise the issue at the domestic level.\n",
      "34. The applicant did not submit any specific comments.\n",
      "35. The Court observes that the applicant complained about the conditions of his pre-trial detention to the prosecutor and tried to obtain redress in the Russian courts (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Accordingly, it rejects the Government s objection.\n",
      "36. Taking into account the Court s findings in the Ananyev and Others judgment (cited above, 93-118), it considers that the applicant did not have at his disposal an effective domestic remedy for his complaints, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention.\n",
      "III. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "37. The applicant also complained that he could not adequately prepare for the trial because of poor conditions of his detention. The Court notes that the applicant did not raise that complaint before the courts during the criminal proceedings against him. It follows that the complaint is inadmissible due to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in accordance with Article 35 1 of the Convention.\n",
      "IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "38. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n",
      "If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\n",
      "A. Damage\n",
      "39. The applicant claimed 15,840 euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n",
      "40. The Government did not comment.\n",
      "41. The Court has found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention on account of the absence of an effective domestic remedy for the applicant s complaint about the conditions of his pre-trial detention.\n",
      "42. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, cited above, 173). Accordingly, it rejects the applicant s claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n",
      "B. Costs and expenses\n",
      "43. The applicant did not claim any costs and expenses incurred either before the domestic courts or the Court.\n"

      "I. LAW\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Court finds that the applicants have standing to bring their complaints before the Court, relying on Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Preamble, § 2 and 3) and the Court's case-law (see, for example, Benyaminson and Others v. Ukraine, no. 31585/02, § 83, 26 July 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Having regard to Article 6 1 and Article 13 of the Convention, the Court holds that the excessive length of the criminal proceedings and the lack of an effective remedy in domestic law have breached the Convention rights of the applicants.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Pursuant to Article 41 of the Convention, the Court finds it reasonable to award the sums indicated in the appended table in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants, as per its case-law (see, inter alia, Bevz v. Ukraine, no. 7307/05, 52, 18 June 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Court notes that, in accordance with Article 41 of the Convention, the applicants had a legitimate expectation of a fair and efficient disposal of their case and that the excessive length of the proceedings has caused them additional stress, anxiety, and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. In respect of the application, the Court considers that the applicants have not relied solely on the excessive length of the criminal proceedings to assert their claim but have also pointed out the lack of an effective remedy in domestic law.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The Court emphasizes the principle that the rights guaranteed by the Convention are subject to the maintenance of a balance between conflicting interests and that the Convention does not guarantee a certain result in the sense of a winning or losing party in a criminal proceeding (see, for example, Harris v. United Kingdom, Series A no. 76, 45, 1982).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The Court also notes that the applicants have not suffered any pecuniary loss as a result of the State's failure to comply with their rights under the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. However, the Court concludes that the breach of Article 6 1 and Article 13 of the Convention has caused the applicants non-pecuniary damage, which can be compensated by the award of a sum in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Finally, the Court stresses that the award made is equitable and constitutes a fair balance between the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for example, Bevz v. Ukraine, no. 7307/05, 52, 18 June 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The Court hereby awards the applicants, within three months, the amounts indicated in the appended table, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, together with simple interest at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\n"
