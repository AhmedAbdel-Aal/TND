Final Answer:

The ECHR found a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in this case.  Article 3 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

The Court's reasoning likely focused on the following:

* **Factual Circumstances:** The applicants alleged inadequate detention conditions during their transport. While the specific details of these conditions are not provided, the Court found their claims credible enough to establish a violation.
* **Legal Notion:** Article 3 of the ECHR prohibits "inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." This is a broad standard, and the Court has interpreted it to encompass a wide range of conditions that would be considered cruel, inhumane, or degrading by contemporary standards.
* **Connection between Legal Notion and Factual Circumstances:** The Court likely found that the alleged inadequate detention conditions, whatever they may have been, rose to the level of being "inhuman or degrading" under Article 3. This could be based on established case law where similar conditions have been found to violate Article 3.

**Important Note:** Without more specific details about the nature of the inadequate conditions, it is impossible to provide a more precise analysis of the Court's reasoning.
