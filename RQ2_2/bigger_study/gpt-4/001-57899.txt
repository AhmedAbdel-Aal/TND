In the case of Mr. Anthony Boner, the legal arguments raised by his defense, particularly regarding the alleged violation of his rights under Article 6 para. 3 (c) of the European Convention on Human Rights, focused on the following key points:

1. **Right to Legal Assistance:**
   - Mr. Boner argued that his right to free legal assistance, as guaranteed by Article 6 para. 3 (c), was violated during the appeal process. Despite the seriousness of his conviction and the legal complexity of the issues raised, he was not provided with legal representation for his appeal after his legal aid application was rejected. He contended that the "interests of justice" required that he be granted legal aid, given the significant consequences of his conviction, including an eight-year prison sentence.

2. **Withdrawal of Legal Representation:**
   - After his conviction, Mr. Boner sought to appeal, and new solicitors were instructed. However, the solicitors and counsel who initially supported the appeal eventually withdrew their services, citing that they could not find substantial grounds to support the appeal, specifically regarding the admissibility of Mrs. G.’s testimony. They believed there was insufficient merit in the appeal, and thus, legal aid was not granted.
   - Despite this, Mr. Boner, without legal knowledge or professional assistance, proceeded with his appeal. He argued that without legal representation, he was unable to adequately present or argue his case during the appellate proceedings, placing him at a severe disadvantage.

3. **Admissibility of Witness Testimony:**
   - A key legal argument raised in the initial trial and continued in the appeal related to the admissibility of the testimony of Mrs. G., a prosecution witness. The defense argued that her presence in the courtroom before her testimony could have influenced her statements, which should have disqualified her from giving evidence. The trial judge, however, ruled that her testimony was admissible, a decision that Mr. Boner challenged during his appeal, arguing that this error in judicial discretion affected the fairness of his trial.

4. **Imbalance in Representation During Appeal:**
   - Mr. Boner’s appeal raised the issue of the significant disparity between his own lack of legal representation and the Crown’s continued representation by counsel during the appeal hearing. This imbalance, he argued, created a situation in which justice was not only compromised but appeared to be so, as he was unable to make a meaningful contribution to the proceedings while the Crown had the advantage of professional legal support.

5. **Substantive and Procedural Justice:**
   - Although the defense could not establish substantive injustice (i.e., that the outcome of the trial was wrong due to the lack of legal aid), the argument under Article 6 para. 3 (c) was that procedural justice had been violated. Mr. Boner’s lack of legal assistance, combined with the complex legal issues of his case, meant that he could not properly defend himself or navigate the legal system effectively during the appeal.

These legal arguments were central to Mr. Boner’s claim that his rights under Article 6 para. 3 (c) had been violated, as the "interests of justice" required that he be provided with legal aid to ensure a fair and equitable appeal process.
