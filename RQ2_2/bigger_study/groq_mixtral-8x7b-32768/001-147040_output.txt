Senior Agent -> Question: Can you provide the facts of the legal case I will be analyzing?


Junior Agent -> Answer: The legal case involves an application (no. 28505/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) by a Russian national, Mr Andrey Nikolayevich Istratov. The applicant was born in 1982 and was held in remand prison IZ-77/3 in Moscow between 22 November 2008 and 7 September 2009 on suspicion of rape. The applicant complained about the conditions of his detention, alleging overcrowding, mouldy walls, lack of toiletries, poor quality food, and inadequate ventilation. The Government submitted certificates indicating that the applicant was held in cells with varying sizes, equipped with sleeping places and actual occupancy ranging from 2 to 9 inmates, with bedding and toiletries provided. The prison population register showed that the cells had more sleeping places than the actual number of detainees. The applicant had complained to the Moscow city prosecutor about the conditions of his detention, and later brought a civil claim for compensation, which was rejected. Criminal proceedings against the applicant resulted in a custodial sentence, which was upheld on appeal. The ECHR declared the complaints concerning the conditions of the applicant's pretrial detention and the lack of an effective domestic remedy admissible, found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, and held that the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction.

Question: What are the specific legal norms from the European Convention on Human Rights that are applicable to this case?

Final Answer: The specific legal norms from the European Convention on Human Rights that are applicable to this case are Article 3, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment, and Article 13, which guarantees the right to an effective remedy. The applicant, Mr. Andrey Nikolayevich Istratov, alleges that the conditions of his pretrial detention amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment, thereby violating Article 3. He also argues that there was no effective domestic remedy available to him, thereby violating Article 13. The European Court of Human Rights will examine these allegations in light of the Convention's provisions and the case law developed in relation to these articles.
