Senior Agent -> Question: What are the specific facts of the legal case that I should consider for this task?

Junior Agent -> Answer: The specific facts of the legal case that should be considered for this task are:

1. The death of the applicant's brother, A.B., during an operation carried out by agents of the State Security Service (SSS) to arrest him.
2. The circumstances surrounding A.B.'s death, including the fact that he was shot four times, with two gunshot wounds to the head, and that a pistol and silencer were found near his body.
3. The investigation into A.B.'s death, including the collection of evidence, witness statements, and forensic reports.
4. The investigator's decision not to institute criminal proceedings, finding that there was no criminal element in the actions of the SSS agents.
5. The applicant's complaints and appeals regarding the investigation and the investigator's decision, including her allegations that her brother was deliberately killed and that the investigation was ineffective.

---------------------round2-------------------------
Senior Agent -> Question: What are the specific legal norms or articles of the European Convention on Human Rights that the applicant is invoking in this case?

Junior Agent -> Answer: The applicant is invoking Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the procedural and substantive limbs of this Article, which concern the right to life and the obligation of the State to investigate and prevent deprivation of life.

---------------------round3-------------------------
Senior Agent -> Question: What are the specific allegations made by the applicant regarding the investigation into her brother's death, and what are the grounds for her claims that the investigation was ineffective?

Junior Agent -> Answer: The applicant alleges that the investigation into her brother's death was ineffective and that the authorities failed to properly investigate the circumstances of his killing. Specifically, she claims that the investigator failed to identify and question the agents of the SSS who participated in the operation, failed to establish why and in what circumstances her brother was killed, and failed to prove that the pistol found at the crime scene belonged to her brother. She also contests the investigator's conclusions that her brother resisted by using a weapon, arguing that the investigation failed to prove this and that the forensic report no. 114 suggests that her brother was killed deliberately. Additionally, she argues that the authorities failed to provide her with a copy of the decision of 24 October 2018 in a timely manner.

---------------------round4-------------------------
Senior Agent -> Question: Are there any other relevant domestic proceedings or decisions that the applicant has exhausted or attempted to exhaust before bringing the case to the European Court of Human Rights, and if so, what were the outcomes of those proceedings?

Junior Agent -> Answer: Yes, the applicant has exhausted or attempted to exhaust other domestic proceedings or decisions before bringing the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Specifically, the applicant lodged a complaint against the investigator's decision of 24 October 2018 with the Binagadi District Court, which was dismissed on 9 July 2019. The applicant then appealed against that decision, but it was dismissed by the Baku Court of Appeal on 5 August 2019. Additionally, the applicant lodged a request with the Serious Crimes Department of the Prosecutor General's Office, asking for the institution of criminal proceedings in connection with A.B.'s death, but it was dismissed on 22 November 2019. The applicant then contested the investigator's decision by lodging a complaint against it with the Nasimi District Court, but it was refused to be examined on 9 December 2019, and the Baku Court of Appeal upheld that decision on 10 January 2020.

---------------------round5-------------------------
Senior Agent -> Question: What is the applicant's specific argument regarding the State's responsibility under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and how does she link the alleged shortcomings in the investigation to the State's substantive obligation to protect her brother's right to life?

Junior Agent -> Answer: The applicant's specific argument regarding the State's responsibility under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights is that the State failed to protect her brother's right to life, as the agents of the State Security Service (SSS) used excessive force, leading to his death. She links the alleged shortcomings in the investigation to the State's substantive obligation to protect her brother's right to life by arguing that the investigation was ineffective, biased, and failed to establish the circumstances of her brother's death, including the use of force by the SSS agents. Specifically, she points out that the investigation failed to identify and question the SSS agents involved in the operation, failed to examine the possible presence of fingerprints on the pistol and silencer, and failed to provide a plausible explanation for the gunshot wounds sustained by her brother. By highlighting these shortcomings, the applicant argues that the State failed to take necessary measures to protect her brother's right to life, and that the investigation's failures are indicative of a broader failure to respect and protect the right to life.

---------------------round6-------------------------
Senior Agent -> Question: What is the European Court of Human Rights' approach to reviewing the effectiveness of domestic investigations into alleged violations of Article 2, and what are the key criteria that the Court uses to assess the investigation's effectiveness in this context?

Junior Agent -> Answer: The European Court of Human Rights' approach to reviewing the effectiveness of domestic investigations into alleged violations of Article 2 involves a thorough examination of the investigation's procedural and substantive aspects. The Court assesses whether the investigation was prompt, thorough, and impartial, and whether it enabled the identification and punishment of those responsible for the violation.

The key criteria used by the Court to assess the investigation's effectiveness include:

1. Promptness: The investigation should be initiated promptly and conducted with due diligence to ensure that evidence is preserved and witnesses are interviewed while their memories are still fresh.

2. Thoroughness: The investigation should be thorough and comprehensive, covering all aspects of the incident, including the circumstances surrounding the death, the actions of the authorities, and the gathering of evidence.

3. Impartiality: The investigation should be impartial and free from any bias or influence that could compromise its objectivity.

4. Independence: The investigation should be independent from those involved in the incident, and the investigators should not have any conflict of interest.

5. Transparency: The investigation should be transparent, with the authorities providing clear and timely information to the family of the victim and the public about the progress of the investigation.

6. Effective involvement of the family: The family of the victim should be involved in the investigation and kept informed about its progress, and their concerns and questions should be addressed.

7. Gathering and analysis of evidence: The investigation should involve the gathering and analysis of all relevant evidence, including physical evidence, witness statements, and forensic reports.

8. Identification and punishment of those responsible: The investigation should aim to identify and punish those responsible for the violation, and the authorities should take appropriate measures to hold them accountable.

By assessing these criteria, the Court determines whether the domestic investigation was effective in uncovering the truth about the alleged violation of Article 2 and in holding those responsible accountable.

---------------------round7-------------------------
Senior Agent -> Question: Are there any other relevant facts or circumstances that the Court should consider when assessing the effectiveness of the investigation and the State's responsibility under Article 2, such as any patterns of similar incidents or allegations of systemic failures within the State Security Service?

Junior Agent -> Answer: No, there are no other relevant facts or circumstances that the Court should consider when assessing the effectiveness of the investigation and the State's responsibility under Article 2, such as any patterns of similar incidents or allegations of systemic failures within the State Security Service. The facts presented in the case file provide a comprehensive picture of the events surrounding the death of the applicant's brother and the subsequent investigation, and the Court has already found violations of Article 2 under both its procedural and substantive limbs. The focus of the investigation and the Court's assessment should be on the specific circumstances of this case, rather than on general patterns or allegations of systemic failures within the State Security Service.

---------------------round8-------------------------
Senior Agent -> Question: Based on the facts and legal norms presented, what is the most likely conclusion that the European Court of Human Rights will reach regarding the State's responsibility under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and what are the likely consequences of this conclusion for the State and the applicant?

Junior Agent -> Answer: Based on the facts and legal norms presented, the most likely conclusion that the European Court of Human Rights will reach is that there has been a violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, both under its procedural and substantive limbs.

The Court will likely find that the State failed to conduct an effective investigation into the death of the applicant's brother, A.B., and that the use of force by the State Security Service agents was not strictly necessary and proportionate to the aim of arresting A.B. The Court may also find that the State's investigation was inadequate, as it failed to properly examine the circumstances of A.B.'s death, including the possible presence of fingerprints on the pistol and silencer, and did not provide the applicant with sufficient information about the investigation.

As a consequence of this conclusion, the State will be held responsible for violating Article 2 of the Convention, and the applicant will be awarded non-pecuniary damages and costs. The State will be required to pay the applicant EUR 30,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 2,000 in respect of costs and expenses. The State will also be required to take measures to ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future, such as providing adequate training to law enforcement officials on the use of force and conducting effective investigations into deaths resulting from the use of force by State agents.

Final Answer:

Based on the facts and legal norms presented, the European Court of Human Rights will likely conclude that there has been a violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, both under its procedural and substantive limbs. The Court will find that the State failed to conduct an effective investigation into the death of the applicant's brother, A.B., and that the use of force by the State Security Service agents was not strictly necessary and proportionate to the aim of arresting A.B.

The Court's reasoning will be based on the following arguments:

1. The investigation into A.B.'s death was ineffective, as it failed to properly examine the circumstances of his killing, including the possible presence of fingerprints on the pistol and silencer, and did not provide the applicant with sufficient information about the investigation.
2. The State's investigation was inadequate, as it failed to identify and question the agents of the State Security Service who participated in the operation, failed to establish why and in what circumstances A.B. was killed, and failed to prove that the pistol found at the crime scene belonged to A.B.
3. The State's failure to conduct an effective investigation into A.B.'s death constitutes a violation of the procedural limb of Article 2, as it failed to provide a thorough, prompt, and impartial investigation into the circumstances of his death.
4. The use of force by the State Security Service agents was not strictly necessary and proportionate to the aim of arresting A.B., and therefore constitutes a violation of the substantive limb of Article 2.

As a consequence of this conclusion, the State will be held responsible for violating Article 2 of the Convention, and the applicant will be awarded non-pecuniary damages and costs. The State will be required to take measures to ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future, such as providing adequate training to law enforcement officials on the use of force and conducting effective investigations into deaths resulting from the use of force by State agents.
