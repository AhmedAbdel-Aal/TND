      "I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "17. The applicant complained that the conditions of his detention in remand prison IZ-77/3 of Moscow between 22 November 2008 and 7 September 2009 violated Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n",
      "No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n",
      "A. Admissibility\n",
      "18. With reference to various provisions of the Rules of Court and the Practice Direction on Institution of Proceedings, the Government alleged that the application form had been lodged after a long delay and that its date of posting, rather than that of the applicant s first letter, should be taken as the date of introduction of the case. In their view, that fact had an impact on the admissibility of the complaint, in particular as regards the six-month time-limit set by Article 35 1 of the Convention.\n",
      "19. The applicant did not comment.\n",
      "20. The Court observes that the application form was posted on 4 December 2009, that is within six months from 7 September 2009, when the applicant had left the remand prison, the starting date of the six-month time-limit. The Court concludes that even if it were to accept the Government s argument, the applicant s complaint is not out of time for the purposes of Article 35 1 of the Convention.\n",
      "21. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n",
      "B. Establishment of facts\n",
      "22. The applicant was held in the Moscow remand prison IZ-77/3 between 22 November 2008 and 7 September 2009, that is nine months and fifteen days.\n",
      "23. The Court observes that the Government submitted a large number of documents concerning various aspects of the applicant s detention. Of particular importance is the prison population register, an original document which was prepared during the period of the applicant s stay in the prison and covered a large part of the detention. The documents showed that the applicant had been detained in cells 608, 207, 517 and 510, which measured around 34, 32, 37 and 13 sq. m, respectively.\n",
      "24. The Court however notes that the documents, including the certificates by the director of the prison, the prison population register and the domestic judgments, variously indicated the number of sleeping places and the actual occupancy of the cells (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 11 above).\n",
      "25. Nevertheless, the Court finds that, even considering the highest occupancy figures, the applicant was afforded around 4 sq. m of personal space and that there was no shortage of sleeping places during the period under examination.\n",
      "26. As to the findings of the domestic authorities regarding the lack of personal space (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above), the Court observes that the prosecutor s reply referred to the remand prison in general, rather than to the applicant s personal situation, whereas the domestic judgment did not indicate the actual occupancy of the cells and it is not clear from it why such conclusion was reached.\n",
      "27. The applicant s submissions differed from those of the Government in every aspect save for the number of one cell. Although they were sufficiently detailed, the only evidence corroborating them were the cellmates statements, which contained general assertions without references to concrete details (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, the Court notes that the factual information provided by the Government was not contested by the applicant in his observations in reply. For these reasons, the Court lends credence to the Government s submissions.\n",
      "C. Compliance with Article 3\n",
      "28. The Court found it established that the applicant had been provided with around four square metres of floor surface and disposed of his own sleeping place. It cannot be said that the dimensions of his cells were so small as to restrict the applicant s freedom of movement (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, 143-148, 10 January 2012).\n",
      "29. It also appears that the applicant was allowed a one-hour outdoor exercise daily. Windows were not fitted with metal shutters preventing natural light and fresh air from penetrating into the cells. The cells were additionally equipped with artificial lighting and forced ventilation.\n",
      "30. The Court observes that the lavatory pans, the dining tables and the sleeping places were all located within the cells, but at a sufficient distance from each other. Brick partitions separated the toilets from the rest of the cells. Hot and cold running water was available to detainees and the applicant had regular access to shower and washing facilities.\n",
      "31. Taking into account the cumulative effect of those conditions, the Court considers that the conditions of the applicant s detention in remand prison IZ-77/3 of Moscow between 22 November 2008 and 7 September 2009 cannot be regarded as inhuman or degrading. There has been therefore no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n",
      "II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "32. The applicant further complained that he did not dispose of an effective domestic remedy for his grievance concerning the inhuman conditions of detention, as required by Article 13 of the Convention, which provides that:\n",
      "Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\n",
      "33. The Government, with reference to the Court s judgment of Ananyev and Others v. Russia (cited above) acknowledged the absence of such remedies, but submitted that the applicant was not a victim of the violation since he did not attempt to raise the issue at the domestic level.\n",
      "34. The applicant did not submit any specific comments.\n",
      "35. The Court observes that the applicant complained about the conditions of his pre-trial detention to the prosecutor and tried to obtain redress in the Russian courts (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Accordingly, it rejects the Government s objection.\n",
      "36. Taking into account the Court s findings in the Ananyev and Others judgment (cited above, 93-118), it considers that the applicant did not have at his disposal an effective domestic remedy for his complaints, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention.\n",
      "III. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "37. The applicant also complained that he could not adequately prepare for the trial because of poor conditions of his detention. The Court notes that the applicant did not raise that complaint before the courts during the criminal proceedings against him. It follows that the complaint is inadmissible due to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in accordance with Article 35 1 of the Convention.\n",
      "IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n",
      "38. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n",
      "If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\n",
      "A. Damage\n",
      "39. The applicant claimed 15,840 euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n",
      "40. The Government did not comment.\n",
      "41. The Court has found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention on account of the absence of an effective domestic remedy for the applicant s complaint about the conditions of his pre-trial detention.\n",
      "42. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, cited above, 173). Accordingly, it rejects the applicant s claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n",
      "B. Costs and expenses\n",
      "43. The applicant did not claim any costs and expenses incurred either before the domestic courts or the Court.\n"

      "1. The Court finds that the applicants have standing to bring their complaints before the Court, relying on Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Preamble, § 2 and 3) and the Court's case-law (see, for example, Benyaminson and Others v. Ukraine, no. 31585/02, § 83, 26 July 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Having regard to Article 6 1 and Article 13 of the Convention, the Court holds that the excessive length of the criminal proceedings and the lack of an effective remedy in domestic law have breached the Convention rights of the applicants.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Pursuant to Article 41 of the Convention, the Court finds it reasonable to award the sums indicated in the appended table in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants, as per its case-law (see, inter alia, Bevz v. Ukraine, no. 7307/05, 52, 18 June 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Court notes that, in accordance with Article 41 of the Convention, the applicants had a legitimate expectation of a fair and efficient disposal of their case and that the excessive length of the proceedings has caused them additional stress, anxiety, and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. In respect of the application, the Court considers that the applicants have not relied solely on the excessive length of the criminal proceedings to assert their claim but have also pointed out the lack of an effective remedy in domestic law.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The Court emphasizes the principle that the rights guaranteed by the Convention are subject to the maintenance of a balance between conflicting interests and that the Convention does not guarantee a certain result in the sense of a winning or losing party in a criminal proceeding (see, for example, Harris v. United Kingdom, Series A no. 76, 45, 1982).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The Court also notes that the applicants have not suffered any pecuniary loss as a result of the State's failure to comply with their rights under the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. However, the Court concludes that the breach of Article 6 1 and Article 13 of the Convention has caused the applicants non-pecuniary damage, which can be compensated by the award of a sum in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Finally, the Court stresses that the award made is equitable and constitutes a fair balance between the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for example, Bevz v. Ukraine, no. 7307/05, 52, 18 June 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The Court hereby awards the applicants, within three months, the amounts indicated in the appended table, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, together with simple interest at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\n"
