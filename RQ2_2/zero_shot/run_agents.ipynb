      "The case being analyzed is a notable one dealing with the conditions of pre-trial detention in a Russian remand prison. The applicant, Istratov, was detained from November 2008 to September 2009 and complained that his fundamental rights were violated due to the congested and unhygienic conditions in the prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons provided for justifying the application of legal norms in this case involve the principles of Article 3 of the Convention (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) and Article 13 (right to an effective remedy). \n",
      "\n",
      "General legal norms and principles at play include the notion of ‘effective remedy’, as enshrined in Article 13, which obliges a State to provide an opportunity for an individual to claim their rights protected under the Convention. The principles of respect for human dignity, safety, and well-being, as embodied in Article 3, are also applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To identify the specific legal norms applied to the facts of the case, we must examine the relevant paragraphs. For instance, paragraph 10 of the facts suggests that the applicant complained to the Moscow city prosecutor about the conditions of his detention, who acknowledged that not every detainee was afforded the statutory standard of four square metres due to overpopulation of the prison. This points to the applicability of the ‘standard’ (four square metres per person) for assessing the material conditions of detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important aspect is the principle of ‘effective remedy’. Paragraph 11 indicates that the applicant brought a civil claim for compensation in connection with inadequate conditions of detention in remand prison IZ77/3. The court then ruled that the applicant was always provided with a separate sleeping place and that the number of detainees never exceeded that of sleeping places, which led to the rejection of the claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the court notes in the Conclusion, there has been no violation of Article 3, as the applicant was always provided with a separate sleeping place and the number of detainees did not exceed that of sleeping places. However, there has been a violation of Article 13, as the government failed to provide an effective remedy for the applicant's complaints. \n",
      "\n",
      "The court's conclusion emphasizes the importance of an effective remedy for those whose rights are being violated, which aligns with the principle enshrined in Article 13.\n"

Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guarantees the right to a fair trial, including the right to a public hearing, the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty, and the right to a fair and public hearing.\\n2. Section 42 of the Austrian Penal Code provides a procedure for terminating proceedings in minor cases without a trial hearing.\\n3. Section 90 par. 1 and section 451 par. 2 of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure govern the termination of proceedings and the application of section 42 of the Penal Code.\\n\\n**Arguments for justifying the application of legal norms:**\\n\\n1. The applicant\\'s denial of the accusations and his request for a hearing and evidence were ignored by the District Court, which indicated that the proceedings were terminated without a trial hearing and without regard for the evidence.\\n2. The District Court\\'s decision, although couched in terms of a \"suspected state of affairs,\" amounted to a finding of guilt, which violated the applicant\\'s right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty.\\n3. The Supreme Court\\'s decision was inadequate as it did not correct the District Court\\'s error and allowed the finding of guilt to stand.\\n4. The procedure used under section 42 of the Penal Code did not provide for a hearing or evidence, which was required by Article 6 of the ECHR.\\n5. The wording of the District Court\\'s decision was not clear and led to ambiguity, which undermined the applicant\\'s right to a fair trial.\\n6. The Supreme Court did not take advantage of the opportunity to correct the District Court\\'s error and declare the decision contrary to the law.\\n\\n**Key phrases and mapping:**\\n\\n1. \"Applying section 42 of the Penal Code\" - corresponds to the requirement of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR.\\n2. \"The conditions of section 42 are met\" - corresponds to the requirement of a finding of guilt under Article 6 of the ECHR.\\n3. \"The conditions of section 42 are not met\" - corresponds to the requirement of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR.\\n4. \"The suspect has a right to a fair and public hearing\" - corresponds to the requirement of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR.\\n5. \"The court has a duty to satisfy itself\" - corresponds to the requirement of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR.\\n6. \"The court must limit itself to ascertaining whether there existed against the suspect sufficient suspicion\" - corresponds to the requirement of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR.\\n\\n**Conditions for the application of Articles:**\\n\\n1.

      "28. The applicant claimed to be the victim of a breach of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 (d) of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2, art. 6-3-d) which provide as follows:\n",
      "\"1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by a ... tribunal ...\n",
      "2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\n",
      "3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n",
      "...\n",
      "...\"\n",
      "In the submission of Mr. Adolf, this breach resulted from the Innsbruck District Court's decision dated 10 January 1978, from the earlier procedure and also from section 42 of the Austrian Penal Code itself.\n",
      "I. THE APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 6 (art. 6)\n",
      "29. The Government's principal submission was that Article 6 (art. 6) was not applicable in the present case since no criminal charge existed at any time or, at least, at the time when the decision at issue was rendered. This view was not shared by the Commission and was contested by the applicant.\n",
      "30. The Court thus has to ascertain whether there was a \"criminal charge\" (\"accusation en mati re p nale\", Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1)) against Mr. Adolf or whether he was \"charged with a criminal offence\" (\"accus d'une infraction\" and \"accus \", Article 6 par. 2 and 3) (art. 6-2, art 6-3).\n",
      "These expressions are to be interpreted as having an \"autonomous\" meaning in the context of the Convention and not on the basis of their meaning in domestic law (see notably, mutatis mutandis, the Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 22, par. 42). The legislation of the State concerned is certainly relevant, but it provides no more than a starting point in ascertaining whether at any time there was a \"criminal charge\" against Mr. Adolf or he was \"charged with a criminal offence\" (see, mutatis mutandis, the Engel and others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 35, par. 82, and the K nig judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, p. 30, par. 89). The prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial favours a \"substantive\", rather than a \"formal\", conception of the \"charge\" referred to by Article 6 (art. 6); it impels the Court to look behind the appearances and examine the realities of the procedure in question in order to determine whether there has been a \"charge\" within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) (see the above-mentioned Deweer judgment, p. 23, par. 44).\n",
      "In particular, the applicant's situation under the domestic legal rules in force has to be examined in the light of the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6), namely the protection of the rights of the defence.\n",
      "31. On 12 August 1977, following Mrs. Proxauf's complaint, the public prosecutor's office had instructed the federal police to investigate \"whether or not a punishable act had been committed\". The police questioned Mr. Adolf and several witnesses about the complaint and then returned the case-file to the public prosecutor's office which, on 28 September 1977, asked the District Court to procure a medical report on the seriousness of Mrs. Proxauf's injury. The Court entered the case in the register and, under the heading \"punishable act\", referred to section 83 of the Penal Code, this being a provision - amongst others - that deals with the infliction of bodily harm. Following receipt of the doctor's opinion, the court assessed the costs of the opinion in a decision of 11 November 1977 which mentioned \"the criminal proceedings against Gustav Adolf under section 83 of the Penal Code\" and described him as \"accused\".\n",
      "In view of these circumstances, which are not contested (see paragraph 11 above), the Court considers that there is a combination of factors demonstrating that at the relevant time there was a \"criminal charge\" against Mr. Adolf within the meaning of the Convention. Since Mr. Adolf complained of the decision dated 10 January 1978 and of the legal basis thereof, namely section 42 of the Penal Code, but not of the institution of proceedings against him, it is unnecessary to determine the precise moment at which he was \"charged\".\n",
      "32. According to the Government, as a matter of law the termination of proceedings took effect on 24 November 1977, so that at least from that date onwards Mr. Adolf could no longer be regarded as a person \"charged with a criminal offence\" within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention.\n",
      "In the Court's opinion, the decision taken by the District Court on that date, which was not notified to the applicant, is inseparable from the reasoned written version dated 10 January 1978, the latter having spelt out the grounds underlying the former. In short, there was - to adopt the expression utilised by the Commission's Delegate - \"a single procedural act effected in several stages\". Besides, this was how the Austrian judicial authorities understood the position: the Generalprokurator's application for annulment, on which the Supreme Court ruled on 28 February 1980, was directed exclusively against the decision dated 10 January 1978 (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above).\n",
      "33. In the submission of the Government, the fact that the District Court applied section 42 of the Penal Code proved that there never was a \"charge\" or an \"offence\" in this case. The Government pointed out, furthermore, that the Supreme Court and the great majority of Austrian legal commentators regard the section as not being concerned with procedure but as providing a substantive ground for exonerating the accused, its purpose, it is said, being to \"decriminalise\" certain acts of a trivial nature by making them non-punishable (see paragraph 22 above).\n",
      "In the first place, the Court observes, as did the Commission's Delegate, that recourse to section 42 cannot affect the existence, or retroactively alter the nature, of the procedures conducted prior to the court order terminating proceedings. The decision dated 10 January 1978 referred to \"the criminal case against Dr. Gustav Adolf for the offence of inflicting bodily harm, within the meaning of section 83 of the Penal Code\" and described him as an \"accused\" (see paragraph 12 above). In the notification of 22 December 1977 (ibid.), the District Court had moreover already mentioned the \"proceedings against Gustav Adolf under section 83 of the Penal Code\".\n",
      "As regards the concept of a non-punishable act, it is clearly in line with the title and text of section 42 (mangelnde Strafw rdigkeit, nicht strafbar). Nevertheless, non-punishable or unpunished criminal offences do exist and Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention does not distinguish between them and other criminal offences; it applies whenever a person is \"charged\" with any criminal offence.\n",
      "34. To sum up, in 1977 Mr. Adolf was subject to a criminal charge (within the meaning of the Convention) to which the reasoned decision dated 10 January 1978 related. Article 6 (art. 6) was thus applicable in the present case.\n",
      "II. COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 6 (art. 6)\n",
      "35. Relying on paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 (d) of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2, art. 6-3-d), the applicant reiterated in substance the arguments he had put forward before the Commission (see paragraph 25 above). In reply, the Government pleaded as their alternative submission that neither the impugned decision of the Innsbruck District Court nor its basis in law, namely section 42 of the Penal Code, infringed the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. The Commission, for its part, considered that there had been a violation of paragraph 2 (art. 6-2), but not of any other paragraph, such violation arising solely from the said decision.\n",
      "36. As to whether section 42 of the Penal Code is in itself compatible with the Convention, the Court would recall its established case-law: \"in proceedings originating in an individual application, [the Court] has to confine its attention, as far as possible, to the issues raised by the concrete case before it\" (see notably the Guzzardi judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, pp. 31-32, par. 88). Accordingly, the Court's task is not review in abstracto under the Convention the provision of domestic law challenged by Mr. Adolf but to review the manner in which that provision was applied to him (see notably, in addition to the Guzzardi judgment, loc. cit., the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, p. 14, par. 41).\n",
      "37. The Government contended that Mr. Adolf was not actually prejudiced by the District Court's decision and was therefore not a victim of a violation of his Convention rights. However, in its use of the word \"victim\", Article 25 (art. 25) denotes \"the person directly affected by the act or omission which is in issue\" - that is to say, in the present case, the applicant; and the existence of a violation is conceivable even in the absence of prejudice, prejudice being relevant only in the context of Article 50 (art. 50) (see notably the Artico judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, p. 18, par. 35).\n",
      "38. In its decision dated 10 January 1978, the District Court stated (see paragraph 12 above):\n",
      "\"... The investigations ... and the expert opinion have shown that in the course of a quarrel the accused flew into a rage and threw an envelope containing a key in the direction of Mrs. Anneliese Schuh who however managed to avoid the missile, while ... Irma Proxauf standing behind her was hit. The key first struck the back of the right hand, causing a superficial abrasion, and then bounced against the left side of the above-mentioned person's chest.\n",
      "The injury found is insignificant as it does not exceed the three-day limit; the fault of the accused may be described as insignificant, and his character gives cause to except that he will conduct himself properly in future.\"\n",
      "In the Court's opinion, this reasoning was capable of suggesting that Mr. Adolf had inflicted bodily harm on Mrs. Proxauf and that he was at fault in doing so. The above-quoted extract is not limited to recounting a \"suspected state of affairs\": it presents as established certain facts alleged by the complainant, without even mentioning that Mr. Adolf had denied throwing any keys and had denounced the complaint as being knowingly false.\n",
      "39. The Government considered that a distinction should be drawn between operative provisions and reasoning adduced; they questioned whether the use of imprecise or incorrect terminology in the reasoning, but not in the operative provisions, of a decision terminating proceedings and hence, in their submission, one that was beneficial to the person concerned, could in itself go counter to the presumption of innocence. They drew attention, in this connection also, to the particular legal character of section 42 of the Penal Code: the application of this section, so they contended, meant that the District Court objectively could not, and subjectively did not, intend to make a finding of legal or moral guilt.\n",
      "According to the Supreme Court and the Austrian authorities, section 42 must be read in the light of, inter alia, its drafting history, the rules of criminal procedure and Article 6 par. 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention, the Convention having constitutional status in . When the section is so construed, the termination of proceedings under it should be understood as being based on the mere existence of suspicion and not on actual findings of fact and guilt (see paragraphs 14, 16 and 24 above).\n",
      "The fact nonetheless remains that the reasoning in the decision dated 10 January 1978 was in terms that, in the opinion of the Court, were well capable of being understood as meaning that Mr. Adolf was guilty of a criminal offence, albeit one that did not merit punishment; as the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, the decision's reasoning forms a whole with and cannot be dissociated from the operative provisions.\n",
      "40. According to the Government, the District Court's decision should be read in conjunction with the judgment of the Supreme Court; this judgment, the Government submitted, clarified the District Court's decision by showing that it was grounded solely on the existence of a \"suspected state of affairs\".\n",
      "The judgment of 28 February 1980 (see paragraph 16 above) did indeed hold that a decision taken in pursuance of section 42 of the Penal Code does not, because of its very character and whatever may be its wording, involve anything in the nature of a verdict of guilt. It would have been preferable, the judgment added, had the District Court stated this explicitly and without ambiguity, but the more or less apposite choice of wording in the reasoning could not deprive the reasoning of the specific significance it had as a result of the nature of the decision given.\n",
      "The Court recognises that the District Court's reasoned decision dated 10 January 1978 must be read with the judgment of the Supreme Court and in the light of it. That judgment has cleared Mr. Adolf of any finding of guilt and thus the presumption of his innocence is no longer called into question. By reason of the nature of section 42 of the Penal Code, the proceedings, on that section being applied, did not and could not terminate with any finding of guilt; it was therefore not necessary for the District Court to proceed with any hearing in the case or examination of evidence.\n",
      "41. There has accordingly been no breach of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention.\n"
