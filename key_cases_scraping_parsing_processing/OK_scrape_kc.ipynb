      "--Line: PROCEDURE\n",
      "--Line: 1.  The case originated in an application (no. 7189/21) against the French Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a French national, Mr Damien Carême (“the applicant”), on 28 January 2021.\n",
      "--Line: 2.  The applicant was represented by Ms C. Lepage, a lawyer practising in Paris. The French Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Colas, Director of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of European and Foreign Affairs.\n",
      "--Line: 3.  The applicant alleged, in particular, that France had taken insufficient steps to prevent climate change and that this failure entailed a violation of his right to life and his right to respect for his private and family life and his home. The applicant relied on Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention.\n",
      "--Line: 4.  The application was allocated to the Fifth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). On 31 May 2022 the Chamber to which the case had been allocated relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).\n",
      "--Line: 5.  The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 26 §§ 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24 of the Rules of Court. The President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the case should be assigned to the same composition of the Grand Chamber as the cases of Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others v. Switzerland (application no. 53600/20) and Duarte Agostinho and Others v. Portugal and 32 Others (application no. 39371/20) (Rule 24, Rule 42 § 2 and Rule 71), which were relinquished by Chambers of the Third and Fourth Sections, respectively.\n",
      "--Line: 6.  The applicant and the Government each filed memorials on the admissibility and merits of the case. In addition, having been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3), third-party comments were received from the European Network of National Human Rights Institutions (ENNHRI), Our Children’s Trust (“OCT”), Oxfam France and Oxfam International and its affiliates (Oxfam).\n",
      "--Line: 7.  On 11 January 2023 the Grand Chamber decided that in the interest of the proper administration of justice, after the completion of the written stage of the proceedings in the above-mentioned cases, the oral stage would be staggered so that a hearing in the present case and in the Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others case would be held on 29 March 2023, and a hearing in the Duarte Agostinho and Others case would be held before the same composition of the Grand Chamber at a later stage (the hearing was held on 27 September 2023).\n",
      "--Line: 8.  A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 29 March 2023 (Rule 59 § 3).\n",

      "--Line: I. THE APPLICANT’S SITUATION\n",
      "--Line: 9.  The applicant was born in 1960. He is a politician who served as mayor of Grande‑Synthe from 23 March 2001 to 3 July 2019. Since 26 May 2019 he has been a member of the European Parliament. After being elected to the European Parliament, the applicant moved from Grande-Synthe to Brussels (see paragraph 68 below).\n",
      "--Line: 10.  Grande‑Synthe is a municipality of some 23,000 inhabitants located in the Dunkirk area on the coast of the English Channel. As found by the Conseil d’État, Grande‑Synthe is particularly exposed to risks linked to climate change, including the risk of flooding (see paragraph 28 below).\n",
      "--Line: II. PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED BY THE APPLICANT\n",
      "--Line: A. The applicant’s requests to the authorities\n",
      "--Line: 11.  On 19 November 2018 the applicant, acting on his own behalf and in his capacity as mayor of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, and in the name and on behalf of the latter municipality, asked the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity: (a) to take all necessary measures to curb greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions produced on the national territory in order to comply with the relevant commitments made by France in that respect; (b) to take all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives to “make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters” and to prohibit all measures likely to increase GHG emissions; and (c) to implement immediate climate‑change adaptation measures in France.\n",
      "--Line: 12.  The above‑mentioned authorities did not reply to the requests made by the applicant and the municipality of Grande‑Synthe.\n",
      "--Line: B. Proceedings in the Conseil d’État\n",
      "--Line: 1. The applicant’s legal action\n",
      "--Line: 13.  In the absence of a response from the authorities, on 23 January 2019 the applicant, acting on his own behalf and in his capacity as mayor of Grande‑Synthe, and in the name and on behalf of the latter municipality, applied to the Conseil d’État for judicial review (recours pour excès de pouvoir) of the implicit rejection decisions constituted by the authorities’ failure to reply to their requests.\n",
      "--Line: 14.  The claimants pointed to the adverse effects of climate change, which were already impacting the environment, health and economy of various States around the world. Moreover, relying on the 2018 Special report “1.5oC global warming” of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”), they pointed to the future risks linked to climate change and, in that respect, to the necessity of taking urgent and ambitious measures in order to progressively limit GHG emissions with a view to achieving the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5oC above pre‑industrial levels. In this context, the claimants pointed to the fact that France was one of the countries in the world most affected by climate change, which had adverse consequences for the health of its citizens and the environment, most notably through the erosion of the coastline and the risk of flooding by 2030. They noted, however, that instead of keeping GHG emissions below the limit set out in Decree no. 2015‑1491 of 18 November 2015, France had in fact increased its carbon budget by 6.7% in 2017 and would be unable to meet the targets set for the period 2015‑18.\n",
      "--Line: 15.  As regards the situation of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, the claimants argued that its geographical location left it particularly exposed to the risks of climate change, namely more frequent heavy rain and rising sea levels, which increased the risk of coastal and inland flooding. Moreover, heatwaves depleted the soil and aggravated pollution in the area. There was also a risk that any resulting environmental disasters would lead to significant socio‑economic costs. For instance, the consequences of climate change already observed on the territory of the municipality had given rise to costs of between 100,000 and 500,000 euros (EUR) for the period between 1995 and 2010. In the claimants’ view, while the municipality of Grande‑Synthe was doing its utmost to address the effects of climate change, this would not be sufficient in the absence of effective action taken at national level. Against this background, the claimants argued that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe had an interest in bringing proceedings in the Conseil d’État against any decision relating to the risks resulting from climate change on its territory.\n",
      "--Line: 16.  As regards the applicant’s situation, the claimants submitted that, having regard to his powers and responsibilities as the mayor of Grande‑Synthe, as provided by Article L. 2212‑2 of the General Code on Territorial Authorities (see paragraph 50 below), and the delegation given to him by the Municipal Council to pursue legal actions on behalf of the municipality, his legal action in relation to the impact of climate change on Grande‑Synthe was admissible. Moreover, they argued that the legal action brought by the applicant on his own behalf as a citizen was justified under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention.\n",
      "--Line: 17.  As regards the merits of their legal action, relying on domestic and EU law, as well as the Paris Agreement[1], the municipality of Grande‑Synthe and Mr Carême argued that the government had a positive duty to take effective measures to address climate change, including the necessary adaptation measures, which, in their view, it had failed to take. Moreover, relying on the Court’s case‑law in L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom (9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑III), Öneryıldız v. Turkey ([GC], no. 48939/99, ECHR 2004‑XII), López Ostra v. Spain (9 December 1994, Series A no. 303‑C) and Tătar v. Romania (no. 67021/01, 27 January 2009), they argued that Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention imposed a positive obligation on States Parties to adopt adequate measures to ensure effective protection of the environment and human health, in particular through the establishment of an appropriate and effective legal framework. In this respect, they invited the Conseil d’État to follow the conclusions of the Netherlands Supreme Court in the Urgenda case[2].\n",
      "--Line: 18.  Finally, the claimants asked the Conseil d’État to make the following order:\n",
      "--Line: “SET ASIDE the implicit rejection decisions constituted by the failure to reply of the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity concerning [the claimants’] requests, first, that all necessary measures be taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions produced on the national territory, in order to comply, at minimum, with the relevant commitments made by France [in that respect]; secondly, that immediate climate‑change adaptation measures be taken in France; and finally, that all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives be taken to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters and to prohibit all measures likely to increase greenhouse gas emissions;\n",
      "--Line: ORDER the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity to take all necessary measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions produced on the national territory, in order to comply, at minimum, with the relevant national and international commitments made by France [in that respect], within a period of six months;\n",
      "--Line: ORDER the [the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity] to take immediate climate‑change adaptation measures in France, within a period of six months maximum;\n",
      "--Line: ORDER [the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity] to take all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters and to prohibit all measures likely to increase greenhouse gas emissions, within a period of six months maximum;\n",
      "--Line: ...”\n",
      "--Line: 2. The parties’ submissions to the Conseil d’État\n",
      "--Line: 19.  In its reply to the legal action before the Conseil d’État, the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Solidarity (“the Ministry”) argued that the claimants’ request to order the authorities to take the necessary legislative initiatives concerning climate change was outside the judicial competence of the Conseil d’État. The Ministry further argued that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe and its mayor had no legal interest in bringing a legal action in the Conseil d’État as the issues relating to the legislation on climate change did not specifically affect the municipality. In the Ministry’s view, although the municipality of Grande‑Synthe was situated within the perimeter of the territory subject to a heightened risk of flooding (Territoire à risque important d’inondation “TRI”), it did not have direct access to the sea and the relevant TRI simulations of coastal flooding in relation to climate change did not suggest that it would affect the municipality of Grande‑Synthe. Moreover, the Ministry pointed out that the scientific community did not attribute the current erosion of France’s coastline to climate change and that, in any event, the municipality of Grande‑Synthe would have to demonstrate a direct link between climate change and the changes that had taken place on its territory. However, even assuming that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe could demonstrate with certainty that it was suffering the impacts of climate change, in the Ministry’s view, it had failed to identify the exact decisions which it was challenging and its standing to bring the legal action at issue could not be established on the basis of Article L. 2212‑2 of the General Code on Territorial Authorities (see paragraph 50 below).\n",
      "--Line: 20.  As to whether the appeal lodged by the applicant on his own behalf was admissible, the Ministry was of the view that the sole fact that he was a person who had rights under the Convention did not suffice to confer on him an interest in bringing proceedings in the Conseil d’État concerning the issues of climate change.\n",
      "--Line: 21.  With respect to the merits of the case, the Ministry argued that the claimants could not rely on the Paris Agreement as it was not intended to confer any rights on individuals and that, in any event, the commitments by France under the Agreement had to be viewed in the context of the collective commitments of EU member States. In this connection, the Ministry was of the view that France was compliant with the requirements and goals set out at EU level. Similarly, citing Guerra and Others v. Italy (19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑I), the Ministry contended that by providing a comprehensive legislative and regulatory framework, France was compliant with its obligations flowing from the Convention. Lastly, the Ministry argued that the claimants had not demonstrated any relevant breach of the domestic law concerning climate change. In these circumstances, the Ministry contended that the claimants’ action, as a whole, should be rejected.\n",
      "--Line: 22.  In their reply to the Ministry’s submission, the claimants argued that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe was in fact directly affected by the risk of flooding. They contended that the TRI on which the Ministry had relied was outdated and not in line with the relevant IPCC and domestic predictions and studies, which showed that the municipality was at risk of coastal flooding by 2040. In this connection, the claimants submitted that the existing infrastructure to protect against such flooding had not been designed for the contemporary effects of climate change. Similarly, the claimants strongly objected to the Ministry’s submission that the current erosion of France’s coastline was not attributable to climate change. According to them, both the IPCC and certain domestic studies had clearly established such a link and the risk of erosion was real for the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, which was a coastal territory that was extremely flat, situated in part below sea level, criss‑crossed by a network of water drainage channels (watringues) and composed of clay soils. The claimants also argued that the possible direct and indirect adverse consequences of climate change on the interests which the municipality was obliged to protect conferred on it an interest in bringing an action in the Conseil d’État.\n",
      "--Line: 23.  As regards whether the appeal lodged by Mr Carême on his own behalf was admissible, the claimants pointed to the fact that his house was located less than four kilometres from the coastline and that according to some predictions (Coastal Risk Screening Tool[3]) his house would be flooded by 2040 as a result of the effects of climate change. The applicant had not therefore lodged the legal action as an ordinary citizen but as someone with a concrete legal interest, since in a foreseeable future his house was at real risk of flooding linked to climate change, which would therefore affect his property and his day‑to‑day environment. Moreover, when discussing the applicant’s interest in bringing an action in the Conseil d’État, it was necessary to take into account the nature of climate litigation, which was intended to protect not only current interests but also the interests of future generations.\n",
      "--Line: 24.  As regards the merits of their legal action, the claimants reiterated their earlier arguments and disagreed with the Ministry’s views concerning France’s compliance with its obligations under the Paris Agreement and EU and national law in respect of the necessary measures to be taken to address the adverse effects of climate change. As regards, in particular, the arguments made under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention, the claimants pointed out that according to the Court’s case‑law, in addition to the obligation to put in place a regulatory framework, the States had a duty to take preventive measures to protect the right to life (citing Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 101 and 109, and Brincat and Others v. Malta, nos. 60908/11 and 4 others, 24 July 2014). In the claimants’ view, by failing to comply with its duty to reduce GHG emissions, the State had failed to comply with its protective obligation under the Convention. Moreover, the claimants argued that although in its 2017 Climate Plan France had made an ambitious commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the existing legislative and regulatory framework was insufficient to achieve that objective (citing the findings of the 2019 Report of the High Council on Climate[4]). In this connection, they also pointed out that in 2018 GHG emissions in France had remained above the set objectives (citing a report of the Climate & Energy Observatory). The insufficiency of the relevant framework was, in the claimants’ view, in breach of the State’s obligations to guarantee the enjoyment of the right to life (Article 2) and the right to private and family life (Article 8) under the Convention.\n",
      "--Line: 25.  The following entities intervened in the proceedings in the Conseil d’État: the cities of Paris and Grenoble, the non‑governmental organisations Oxfam France, Greenpeace France and Notre Affaire à Tous, and the Fondation pour la Nature et l’Homme.\n",
      "--Line: 3. The Conseil d’État’s decision\n",
      "--Line: 26.  On 19 November 2020 the Conseil d’État found that the claimants’ request to order the authorities to take the necessary legislative initiatives to tackle climate change related to the issue of the separation of powers in the context of a legislative process, and was not amenable to judicial review. In particular, it reasoned as follows:\n",
      "--Line: “... [T]he fact that the executive refrains from submitting a legislative proposal to Parliament concerns the relations between the constitutional public authorities and therefore falls outside the jurisdiction of the administrative courts. Consequently, the arguments set out in the legal action, in so far as they are directed against the implicit refusal of the claimants’ requests for the adoption of legislative provisions, must be rejected.”\n",
      "--Line: 27.  On the other hand, the Conseil d’État considered that the requests to set aside the implicit rejection decisions concerning the taking of necessary measures to curb GHG emissions produced on the national territory, regulatory measures to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters, and climate‑change adaptation measures, were amenable to judicial review.\n",
      "--Line: 28.  As regards the claimants’ interest in pursuing the requests, the Conseil d’État, distinguishing between the municipality and the applicant, found:\n",
      "--Line: “It follows from the case file, and in particular from the information published by the National Observatory on the effects of global warming, that the Dunkirk area has been assessed as being at a very high level of exposure to climate risk. In this respect, the municipality of Grande‑Synthe argues, without being seriously challenged on this point, that owing to its immediate proximity to the coast and the physical characteristics of its territory, it is exposed in the medium term to high and increased risks of flooding, and an increase in episodes of severe drought, with the effect not only of a reduction and degradation of water resources, but also significant damage to built‑up areas, given the geological characteristics of the soil. While these concrete consequences of climate change are likely to have full effect on the territory of the municipality only by 2030 or 2040, their inevitability, in the absence of effective measures taken quickly to prevent the causes and in view of the time frame for public policy action in this area, is such as to justify the need to act without delay. Consequently, the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, in view of its level of exposure to the risks arising from the phenomenon of climate change and the direct and certain impact [of climate change] on its situation and the interests for which it is responsible, has an interest conferring on it standing to seek the setting‑aside of the contested implicit [rejection] decisions. The circumstance, invoked by the Minister in support of her objection, that the effects of climate change are likely to affect the interests of a significant number of municipalities is not such as to call into question that interest.\n",
      "--Line: On the other hand, Mr Carême, who merely argues, in his capacity as a citizen, that his current residence is located in an area likely to be subject to flooding by 2040, has no such interest.”\n",
      "--Line: 29.  In this connection, in his conclusions on this case, the public rapporteur (le rapporteur public) had made the following comments on the question of the applicant’s lack of interest to bring proceedings:\n",
      "--Line: “[His status as mayor] is not sufficient to confer on him an interest in bringing proceedings, nor is the fact that his current residence is located in an area likely to be flooded annually in 2040: there is no indication as to where his residence will be in the years to come, let alone in twenty years or more, so that his [personal] interest appears to be affected in too uncertain a manner on this point. We propose to dismiss the application in so far as it emanates from him for lack of interest to bring proceedings.”\n",
      "--Line: 30.  Furthermore, the Conseil d’État declared admissible the interventions of the cities of Paris and Grenoble noting in particular that their interest in intervening was based on the fact that those urban areas had been identified by the National Observatory on the effects of global warming as being at a very high level of exposure to climate risks. Moreover, having regard to their action to combat the adverse anthropogenic effects of climate change, the Conseil d’État declared admissible the above‑noted non‑governmental associations’ interventions (see paragraph 25 above). The third‑party interventions were accepted in so far as they concerned the admissible part of the action brought by the municipality of Grande‑Synthe.\n",
      "--Line: 31.  Furthermore, relying on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”)[5], the Paris Agreement and EU law (2020 Climate and Energy Package)[6], the Conseil d’État pointed out that States had a shared but differentiated responsibility to take the necessary measures to address climate change by reducing GHG emissions. Moreover, the Conseil d’État noted that although the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement did not have a direct effect on individuals and required further measures of implementation in order to produce such effects, they had to be taken into consideration when interpreting the domestic law, in particular in relation to the environmental objectives fixed by States. In this connection, the Conseil d’État noted that when fixing France’s objective to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code (see paragraph 40 below) referred to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Moreover, Article L. 222‑1 A of the Environment Code (see paragraph 42 below) provided that the maximum level of national GHG emissions was to be fixed for the period 2015‑18 and then for consecutive periods of five years thereafter. Within this framework, the Decree of 18 November 2015 fixed the carbon budget for the first period at a maximum limit of 442 Mt CO2e per year.\n",
      "--Line: 32.  However, from the information available in the file, the Conseil d’État found that for the period 2015‑18 France had surpassed its first carbon budget target by 62 Mt CO2e per year and thus reduced GHG emissions by only 1%, instead of the planned 2.2% per year. In this connection, the Conseil d’État noted that the 2019 and 2020 reports of the High Council on Climate had found that the policies put in place to achieve the fixed objectives concerning the reduction of GHG emissions had been insufficient.\n",
      "--Line: 33.  The Conseil d’État further noted that the Decree of 21 April 2020 had significantly modified the second carbon budget (period 2019‑23) initially set in the Decree of 18 November 2015, by increasing the maximum limit of GHG emissions from 399 to 422 Mt CO2e per year. As regards the third carbon budget (period 2024‑28), the Decree of 21 April 2020 had only slightly modified the maximum limit initially set in the Decree of 18 November 2015 by increasing it from 358 to 359 Mt CO2e per year. Finally, it noted that the Decree of 21 April 2020 had fixed the fourth carbon budget (period 2029‑30) at 300 Mt CO2e per year. In the view of the Conseil d’État, this fourth carbon budget would allow France to achieve its final objective of reducing GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2030, as required by Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code, and by 37% compared to 2005 levels, as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/842.[7] However, globally, the modifications introduced by the Decree of 21 April 2020 had led to most of the efforts required being postponed until after 2020, in accordance with a road map which had never yet been attained. At the same time, the most recent scientific evidence, including the reports published by the IPCC, showed that climate risks would increase if the temperature continued to rise, and therefore the European Commission was considering proposing to increase the EU’s 2030 GHG emissions reduction target to -55% compared to the 1990 emissions level.\n",
      "--Line: 34.  In view of these considerations, the Conseil d’État concluded that further investigations were needed as regards the part of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe’s submissions relating to the implicit rejection of the request to take all necessary measures to curb GHG emissions produced on the national territory. As regards the part of the legal action relating to regulatory measures to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters, the Conseil d’État considered that it was insufficiently substantiated. Lastly, with regard to the need to take climate‑change adaptation measures, the argument could not validly be raised.\n",
      "--Line: 35.  Following further investigations concerning the measures taken by the authorities to curb GHG emissions, on 1 July 2021 the Conseil d’État set aside the authorities’ implicit rejection of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe’s request in that respect. The Conseil d’État found, in particular, that the reduction in GHG emissions in 2019 had been small and that the reduction in 2020 had not been sufficient, having regard to the reduced economic activity owing to the public‑health crisis. It also found that compliance with the pathway set to achieve emission reduction targets of reducing GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2030, as required by Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code, and by 37% compared to 2005 levels, as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/842 – which required a 12% reduction in emissions in the period 2024‑28 pursuant to the Decree of 21 April 2020 – did not appear to be feasible if new measures were not rapidly adopted.\n",
      "--Line: 36.  In the light of these findings, the Conseil d’État ordered the authorities to take additional measures by 31 March 2022 to meet the GHG emissions reduction targets set out in Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code and Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2018/842.\n",
      "--Line: C. Subsequent proceedings in the Conseil d’État\n",
      "--Line: 37.  On 1 April 2022 the municipality of Grande‑Synthe lodged a legal action in the Conseil d’État requesting that it impose a financial penalty on the State for non‑execution of the Conseil d’État’s judgment of 1 July 2021.\n",
      "--Line: 38.  On 10 May 2023 the Conseil d’État found that while the government had taken additional measures to tackle climate change and thereby demonstrated its determination to implement the Conseil d’État’s decision, there was still no sufficiently credible guarantee that the GHG emissions reduction pathway would actually be attained. The Conseil d’État therefore ordered the government to take additional measures by 30 June 2024, and to submit, by 31 December 2023, a progress report detailing these measures and their effectiveness.\n",

On 19 November 2018 the applicant, acting on his own behalf and in his capacity as mayor of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, and in the name and on behalf of the latter municipality, asked the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity: (a) to take all necessary measures to curb greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions produced on the national territory in order to comply with the relevant commitments made by France in that respect; (b) to take all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives to “make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters” and to prohibit all measures likely to increase GHG emissions; and (c) to implement immediate climate‑change adaptation measures in France.\n",
      "12.  The above‑mentioned authorities did not reply to the requests made by the applicant and the municipality of Grande‑Synthe.\n",
      "B. Proceedings in the Conseil d’État\n",
      "1. The applicant’s legal action\n",
      "13.  In the absence of a response from the authorities, on 23 January 2019 the applicant, acting on his own behalf and in his capacity as mayor of Grande‑Synthe, and in the name and on behalf of the latter municipality, applied to the Conseil d’État for judicial review (recours pour excès de pouvoir) of the implicit rejection decisions constituted by the authorities’ failure to reply to their requests.\n",
      "14.  The claimants pointed to the adverse effects of climate change, which were already impacting the environment, health and economy of various States around the world. Moreover, relying on the 2018 Special report “1.5oC global warming” of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”), they pointed to the future risks linked to climate change and, in that respect, to the necessity of taking urgent and ambitious measures in order to progressively limit GHG emissions with a view to achieving the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5oC above pre‑industrial levels. In this context, the claimants pointed to the fact that France was one of the countries in the world most affected by climate change, which had adverse consequences for the health of its citizens and the environment, most notably through the erosion of the coastline and the risk of flooding by 2030. They noted, however, that instead of keeping GHG emissions below the limit set out in Decree no. 2015‑1491 of 18 November 2015, France had in fact increased its carbon budget by 6.7% in 2017 and would be unable to meet the targets set for the period 2015‑18.\n",
      "15.  As regards the situation of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, the claimants argued that its geographical location left it particularly exposed to the risks of climate change, namely more frequent heavy rain and rising sea levels, which increased the risk of coastal and inland flooding. Moreover, heatwaves depleted the soil and aggravated pollution in the area. There was also a risk that any resulting environmental disasters would lead to significant socio‑economic costs. For instance, the consequences of climate change already observed on the territory of the municipality had given rise to costs of between 100,000 and 500,000 euros (EUR) for the period between 1995 and 2010. In the claimants’ view, while the municipality of Grande‑Synthe was doing its utmost to address the effects of climate change, this would not be sufficient in the absence of effective action taken at national level. Against this background, the claimants argued that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe had an interest in bringing proceedings in the Conseil d’État against any decision relating to the risks resulting from climate change on its territory.\n",
      "16.  As regards the applicant’s situation, the claimants submitted that, having regard to his powers and responsibilities as the mayor of Grande‑Synthe, as provided by Article L. 2212‑2 of the General Code on Territorial Authorities (see paragraph 50 below), and the delegation given to him by the Municipal Council to pursue legal actions on behalf of the municipality, his legal action in relation to the impact of climate change on Grande‑Synthe was admissible. Moreover, they argued that the legal action brought by the applicant on his own behalf as a citizen was justified under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention.\n",
      "17.  As regards the merits of their legal action, relying on domestic and EU law, as well as the Paris Agreement[1], the municipality of Grande‑Synthe and Mr Carême argued that the government had a positive duty to take effective measures to address climate change, including the necessary adaptation measures, which, in their view, it had failed to take. Moreover, relying on the Court’s case‑law in L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom (9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑III), Öneryıldız v. Turkey ([GC], no. 48939/99, ECHR 2004‑XII), López Ostra v. Spain (9 December 1994, Series A no. 303‑C) and Tătar v. Romania (no. 67021/01, 27 January 2009), they argued that Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention imposed a positive obligation on States Parties to adopt adequate measures to ensure effective protection of the environment and human health, in particular through the establishment of an appropriate and effective legal framework. In this respect, they invited the Conseil d’État to follow the conclusions of the Netherlands Supreme Court in the Urgenda case[2].\n",
      "18.  Finally, the claimants asked the Conseil d’État to make the following order:\n",
      "“SET ASIDE the implicit rejection decisions constituted by the failure to reply of the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity concerning [the claimants’] requests, first, that all necessary measures be taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions produced on the national territory, in order to comply, at minimum, with the relevant commitments made by France [in that respect]; secondly, that immediate climate‑change adaptation measures be taken in France; and finally, that all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives be taken to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters and to prohibit all measures likely to increase greenhouse gas emissions;\n",
      "ORDER the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity to take all necessary measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions produced on the national territory, in order to comply, at minimum, with the relevant national and international commitments made by France [in that respect], within a period of six months;\n",
      "ORDER the [the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity] to take immediate climate‑change adaptation measures in France, within a period of six months maximum;\n",
      "ORDER [the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ecological Transition and Solidarity] to take all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters and to prohibit all measures likely to increase greenhouse gas emissions, within a period of six months maximum;\n",
      "...”\n",
      "2. The parties’ submissions to the Conseil d’État\n",
      "19.  In its reply to the legal action before the Conseil d’État, the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Solidarity (“the Ministry”) argued that the claimants’ request to order the authorities to take the necessary legislative initiatives concerning climate change was outside the judicial competence of the Conseil d’État. The Ministry further argued that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe and its mayor had no legal interest in bringing a legal action in the Conseil d’État as the issues relating to the legislation on climate change did not specifically affect the municipality. In the Ministry’s view, although the municipality of Grande‑Synthe was situated within the perimeter of the territory subject to a heightened risk of flooding (Territoire à risque important d’inondation “TRI”), it did not have direct access to the sea and the relevant TRI simulations of coastal flooding in relation to climate change did not suggest that it would affect the municipality of Grande‑Synthe. Moreover, the Ministry pointed out that the scientific community did not attribute the current erosion of France’s coastline to climate change and that, in any event, the municipality of Grande‑Synthe would have to demonstrate a direct link between climate change and the changes that had taken place on its territory. However, even assuming that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe could demonstrate with certainty that it was suffering the impacts of climate change, in the Ministry’s view, it had failed to identify the exact decisions which it was challenging and its standing to bring the legal action at issue could not be established on the basis of Article L. 2212‑2 of the General Code on Territorial Authorities (see paragraph 50 below).\n",
      "20.  As to whether the appeal lodged by the applicant on his own behalf was admissible, the Ministry was of the view that the sole fact that he was a person who had rights under the Convention did not suffice to confer on him an interest in bringing proceedings in the Conseil d’État concerning the issues of climate change.\n",
      "21.  With respect to the merits of the case, the Ministry argued that the claimants could not rely on the Paris Agreement as it was not intended to confer any rights on individuals and that, in any event, the commitments by France under the Agreement had to be viewed in the context of the collective commitments of EU member States. In this connection, the Ministry was of the view that France was compliant with the requirements and goals set out at EU level. Similarly, citing Guerra and Others v. Italy (19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑I), the Ministry contended that by providing a comprehensive legislative and regulatory framework, France was compliant with its obligations flowing from the Convention. Lastly, the Ministry argued that the claimants had not demonstrated any relevant breach of the domestic law concerning climate change. In these circumstances, the Ministry contended that the claimants’ action, as a whole, should be rejected.\n",
      "22.  In their reply to the Ministry’s submission, the claimants argued that the municipality of Grande‑Synthe was in fact directly affected by the risk of flooding. They contended that the TRI on which the Ministry had relied was outdated and not in line with the relevant IPCC and domestic predictions and studies, which showed that the municipality was at risk of coastal flooding by 2040. In this connection, the claimants submitted that the existing infrastructure to protect against such flooding had not been designed for the contemporary effects of climate change. Similarly, the claimants strongly objected to the Ministry’s submission that the current erosion of France’s coastline was not attributable to climate change. According to them, both the IPCC and certain domestic studies had clearly established such a link and the risk of erosion was real for the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, which was a coastal territory that was extremely flat, situated in part below sea level, criss‑crossed by a network of water drainage channels (watringues) and composed of clay soils. The claimants also argued that the possible direct and indirect adverse consequences of climate change on the interests which the municipality was obliged to protect conferred on it an interest in bringing an action in the Conseil d’État.\n",
      "23.  As regards whether the appeal lodged by Mr Carême on his own behalf was admissible, the claimants pointed to the fact that his house was located less than four kilometres from the coastline and that according to some predictions (Coastal Risk Screening Tool[3]) his house would be flooded by 2040 as a result of the effects of climate change. The applicant had not therefore lodged the legal action as an ordinary citizen but as someone with a concrete legal interest, since in a foreseeable future his house was at real risk of flooding linked to climate change, which would therefore affect his property and his day‑to‑day environment. Moreover, when discussing the applicant’s interest in bringing an action in the Conseil d’État, it was necessary to take into account the nature of climate litigation, which was intended to protect not only current interests but also the interests of future generations.\n",
      "24.  As regards the merits of their legal action, the claimants reiterated their earlier arguments and disagreed with the Ministry’s views concerning France’s compliance with its obligations under the Paris Agreement and EU and national law in respect of the necessary measures to be taken to address the adverse effects of climate change. As regards, in particular, the arguments made under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention, the claimants pointed out that according to the Court’s case‑law, in addition to the obligation to put in place a regulatory framework, the States had a duty to take preventive measures to protect the right to life (citing Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 101 and 109, and Brincat and Others v. Malta, nos. 60908/11 and 4 others, 24 July 2014). In the claimants’ view, by failing to comply with its duty to reduce GHG emissions, the State had failed to comply with its protective obligation under the Convention. Moreover, the claimants argued that although in its 2017 Climate Plan France had made an ambitious commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the existing legislative and regulatory framework was insufficient to achieve that objective (citing the findings of the 2019 Report of the High Council on Climate[4]). In this connection, they also pointed out that in 2018 GHG emissions in France had remained above the set objectives (citing a report of the Climate & Energy Observatory). The insufficiency of the relevant framework was, in the claimants’ view, in breach of the State’s obligations to guarantee the enjoyment of the right to life (Article 2) and the right to private and family life (Article 8) under the Convention.\n",
      "25.  The following entities intervened in the proceedings in the Conseil d’État: the cities of Paris and Grenoble, the non‑governmental organisations Oxfam France, Greenpeace France and Notre Affaire à Tous, and the Fondation pour la Nature et l’Homme.\n",
      "3. The Conseil d’État’s decision\n",
      "26.  On 19 November 2020 the Conseil d’État found that the claimants’ request to order the authorities to take the necessary legislative initiatives to tackle climate change related to the issue of the separation of powers in the context of a legislative process, and was not amenable to judicial review. In particular, it reasoned as follows:\n",
      "“... [T]he fact that the executive refrains from submitting a legislative proposal to Parliament concerns the relations between the constitutional public authorities and therefore falls outside the jurisdiction of the administrative courts. Consequently, the arguments set out in the legal action, in so far as they are directed against the implicit refusal of the claimants’ requests for the adoption of legislative provisions, must be rejected.”\n",
      "27.  On the other hand, the Conseil d’État considered that the requests to set aside the implicit rejection decisions concerning the taking of necessary measures to curb GHG emissions produced on the national territory, regulatory measures to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters, and climate‑change adaptation measures, were amenable to judicial review.\n",
      "28.  As regards the claimants’ interest in pursuing the requests, the Conseil d’État, distinguishing between the municipality and the applicant, found:\n",
      "“It follows from the case file, and in particular from the information published by the National Observatory on the effects of global warming, that the Dunkirk area has been assessed as being at a very high level of exposure to climate risk. In this respect, the municipality of Grande‑Synthe argues, without being seriously challenged on this point, that owing to its immediate proximity to the coast and the physical characteristics of its territory, it is exposed in the medium term to high and increased risks of flooding, and an increase in episodes of severe drought, with the effect not only of a reduction and degradation of water resources, but also significant damage to built‑up areas, given the geological characteristics of the soil. While these concrete consequences of climate change are likely to have full effect on the territory of the municipality only by 2030 or 2040, their inevitability, in the absence of effective measures taken quickly to prevent the causes and in view of the time frame for public policy action in this area, is such as to justify the need to act without delay. Consequently, the municipality of Grande‑Synthe, in view of its level of exposure to the risks arising from the phenomenon of climate change and the direct and certain impact [of climate change] on its situation and the interests for which it is responsible, has an interest conferring on it standing to seek the setting‑aside of the contested implicit [rejection] decisions. The circumstance, invoked by the Minister in support of her objection, that the effects of climate change are likely to affect the interests of a significant number of municipalities is not such as to call into question that interest.\n",
      "On the other hand, Mr Carême, who merely argues, in his capacity as a citizen, that his current residence is located in an area likely to be subject to flooding by 2040, has no such interest.”\n",
      "29.  In this connection, in his conclusions on this case, the public rapporteur (le rapporteur public) had made the following comments on the question of the applicant’s lack of interest to bring proceedings:\n",
      "“[His status as mayor] is not sufficient to confer on him an interest in bringing proceedings, nor is the fact that his current residence is located in an area likely to be flooded annually in 2040: there is no indication as to where his residence will be in the years to come, let alone in twenty years or more, so that his [personal] interest appears to be affected in too uncertain a manner on this point. We propose to dismiss the application in so far as it emanates from him for lack of interest to bring proceedings.”\n",
      "30.  Furthermore, the Conseil d’État declared admissible the interventions of the cities of Paris and Grenoble noting in particular that their interest in intervening was based on the fact that those urban areas had been identified by the National Observatory on the effects of global warming as being at a very high level of exposure to climate risks. Moreover, having regard to their action to combat the adverse anthropogenic effects of climate change, the Conseil d’État declared admissible the above‑noted non‑governmental associations’ interventions (see paragraph 25 above). The third‑party interventions were accepted in so far as they concerned the admissible part of the action brought by the municipality of Grande‑Synthe.\n",
      "31.  Furthermore, relying on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”)[5], the Paris Agreement and EU law (2020 Climate and Energy Package)[6], the Conseil d’État pointed out that States had a shared but differentiated responsibility to take the necessary measures to address climate change by reducing GHG emissions. Moreover, the Conseil d’État noted that although the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement did not have a direct effect on individuals and required further measures of implementation in order to produce such effects, they had to be taken into consideration when interpreting the domestic law, in particular in relation to the environmental objectives fixed by States. In this connection, the Conseil d’État noted that when fixing France’s objective to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code (see paragraph 40 below) referred to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Moreover, Article L. 222‑1 A of the Environment Code (see paragraph 42 below) provided that the maximum level of national GHG emissions was to be fixed for the period 2015‑18 and then for consecutive periods of five years thereafter. Within this framework, the Decree of 18 November 2015 fixed the carbon budget for the first period at a maximum limit of 442 Mt CO2e per year.\n",
      "32.  However, from the information available in the file, the Conseil d’État found that for the period 2015‑18 France had surpassed its first carbon budget target by 62 Mt CO2e per year and thus reduced GHG emissions by only 1%, instead of the planned 2.2% per year. In this connection, the Conseil d’État noted that the 2019 and 2020 reports of the High Council on Climate had found that the policies put in place to achieve the fixed objectives concerning the reduction of GHG emissions had been insufficient.\n",
      "33.  The Conseil d’État further noted that the Decree of 21 April 2020 had significantly modified the second carbon budget (period 2019‑23) initially set in the Decree of 18 November 2015, by increasing the maximum limit of GHG emissions from 399 to 422 Mt CO2e per year. As regards the third carbon budget (period 2024‑28), the Decree of 21 April 2020 had only slightly modified the maximum limit initially set in the Decree of 18 November 2015 by increasing it from 358 to 359 Mt CO2e per year. Finally, it noted that the Decree of 21 April 2020 had fixed the fourth carbon budget (period 2029‑30) at 300 Mt CO2e per year. In the view of the Conseil d’État, this fourth carbon budget would allow France to achieve its final objective of reducing GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2030, as required by Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code, and by 37% compared to 2005 levels, as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/842.[7] However, globally, the modifications introduced by the Decree of 21 April 2020 had led to most of the efforts required being postponed until after 2020, in accordance with a road map which had never yet been attained. At the same time, the most recent scientific evidence, including the reports published by the IPCC, showed that climate risks would increase if the temperature continued to rise, and therefore the European Commission was considering proposing to increase the EU’s 2030 GHG emissions reduction target to -55% compared to the 1990 emissions level.\n",
      "34.  In view of these considerations, the Conseil d’État concluded that further investigations were needed as regards the part of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe’s submissions relating to the implicit rejection of the request to take all necessary measures to curb GHG emissions produced on the national territory. As regards the part of the legal action relating to regulatory measures to make it obligatory to give priority to climate matters, the Conseil d’État considered that it was insufficiently substantiated. Lastly, with regard to the need to take climate‑change adaptation measures, the argument could not validly be raised.\n",
      "35.  Following further investigations concerning the measures taken by the authorities to curb GHG emissions, on 1 July 2021 the Conseil d’État set aside the authorities’ implicit rejection of the municipality of Grande‑Synthe’s request in that respect. The Conseil d’État found, in particular, that the reduction in GHG emissions in 2019 had been small and that the reduction in 2020 had not been sufficient, having regard to the reduced economic activity owing to the public‑health crisis. It also found that compliance with the pathway set to achieve emission reduction targets of reducing GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2030, as required by Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code, and by 37% compared to 2005 levels, as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/842 – which required a 12% reduction in emissions in the period 2024‑28 pursuant to the Decree of 21 April 2020 – did not appear to be feasible if new measures were not rapidly adopted.\n",
      "36.  In the light of these findings, the Conseil d’État ordered the authorities to take additional measures by 31 March 2022 to meet the GHG emissions reduction targets set out in Article L. 100‑4 of the Energy Code and Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2018/842.\n",
      "C. Subsequent proceedings in the Conseil d’État\n",
      "37.  On 1 April 2022 the municipality of Grande‑Synthe lodged a legal action in the Conseil d’État requesting that it impose a financial penalty on the State for non‑execution of the Conseil d’État’s judgment of 1 July 2021.\n",
      "38.  On 10 May 2023 the Conseil d’État found that while the government had taken additional measures to tackle climate change and thereby demonstrated its determination to implement the Conseil d’État’s decision, there was still no sufficiently credible guarantee that the GHG emissions reduction pathway would actually be attained. The Conseil d’État therefore ordered the government to take additional measures by 30 June 2024, and to submit, by 31 December 2023, a progress report detailing these measures and their effectiveness.\n"
