It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. However, since under Article 5 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see, among numerous other authorities, Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, 40-41 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III).\n",

Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion on the admissibility and merits of these complaints.

Here is a structured analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Legal Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Right to Liberty and Security (Article 5)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 5 of the ECHR protects the right to liberty and security, ensuring that no one is deprived of their liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The applicants' complaints about unlawful detention directly engage Article 5. The Court will assess whether the detention was lawful, whether it followed a procedure prescribed by law, and whether it falls within the permissible grounds for detention under Article 5(1).\n",
      "   - **Balancing**: The Court often balances the state's interest in maintaining public order and security against the individual's right to liberty. Any deprivation of liberty must be justified and proportionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Right to a Fair Trial (Article 6)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal.\n",
      "   - **Application**: If any of the applicants' complaints involve procedural issues related to their detention, such as delays in judicial review or lack of access to legal representation, Article 6 may be relevant.\n",
      "   - **Balancing**: The principle of a fair trial may conflict with state interests in expediting legal processes or maintaining confidentiality in certain cases. The Court examines whether the procedural safeguards were adequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prohibition of Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (Article 3)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 3 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n",
      "   - **Application**: If the conditions of detention or the treatment of the applicants while detained are alleged to be inhuman or degrading, Article 3 is engaged.\n",
      "   - **Balancing**: There is no balancing under Article 3, as it is an absolute right. The Court assesses whether the treatment reaches the minimum level of severity to constitute a violation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Right to Respect for Private and Family Life (Article 8)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 8 protects the right to respect for private and family life, home, and correspondence.\n",
      "   - **Application**: If the detention has impacted the applicants' private or family life, such as through separation from family members, Article 8 may be relevant.\n",
      "   - **Balancing**: The Court balances the individual's rights against the state's interest in public safety and order. Any interference must be lawful, necessary, and proportionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Right to an Effective Remedy (Article 13)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 13 ensures the right to an effective remedy before a national authority for violations of rights under the Convention.\n",
      "   - **Application**: If the applicants claim they had no effective domestic remedy to challenge their detention, Article 13 is engaged.\n",
      "   - **Balancing**: The Court examines whether the domestic legal system provides adequate means to address and rectify the alleged violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the primary focus is on Article 5 concerning unlawful detention. However, depending on the specific circumstances and additional complaints raised by the applicants, other Articles such as 3, 6, 8, and 13 may also be relevant. The European Court of Human Rights will assess each complaint in light of these principles, ensuring that any interference with the applicants' rights is justified, lawful, and proportionate.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI have identified the core legal issues and associated ECHR articles raised in the case, primarily focusing on Article 5 regarding unlawful detention, as well as potential implications under Articles 3, 6, 8, and 13. Next, I will extract and analyze the citations referenced in the case to understand how it builds upon or diverges from existing precedents.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Court reiterates that the terms \"lawful\" and \"in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\" in Article 5(1) refer back to national law, emphasizing the obligation of national authorities to conform to both substantive and procedural rules.

      "\n",
      "The references to previous cases, such as Fortalnov and Others v. Russia, Rozhkov v. Russia, and Butkevich v.

      "\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mThe case at hand has the potential to significantly influence future jurisprudence regarding unlawful detention in several key ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reinforcement of Established Principles**: The Court's reaffirmation of the principles established in previous cases, such as the necessity for compliance with national law and the procedural safeguards surrounding detention, reinforces the importance of these standards. This could lead to stricter scrutiny of national laws and practices regarding detention, encouraging states to ensure that their legal frameworks are in line with the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarification of Jurisdictional Issues**: The Court's decision to assert jurisdiction over cases arising from events that occurred before the Russian Federation's withdrawal from the Convention clarifies the temporal scope of the Court's jurisdiction. This may set a precedent for how the Court handles similar cases involving states that have withdrawn or are in the process of withdrawing from the Convention, potentially allowing for continued oversight of human rights violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Broadening of the Definition of Unlawful Detention**: By finding violations of Article 5(1) in the context of unlawful detention, the Court may expand the understanding of what constitutes unlawful detention. This could lead to a broader interpretation of the rights of individuals in detention, particularly in relation to procedural safeguards and the necessity of lawful grounds for detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Impact on National Legal Systems**: The findings in this case may prompt national courts and legislatures to review and amend their laws and practices regarding detention to avoid violations of the Convention. This could lead to reforms aimed at enhancing the protection of individual rights and ensuring that detention practices are transparent, fair, and subject to judicial oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Encouragement of Further Complaints**: The Court's willingness to declare various complaints admissible and to find violations may encourage more individuals to bring cases before the ECHR. This could lead to an increase in the number of cases related to unlawful detention, further shaping the Court's jurisprudence in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Emphasis on Fair Trial Rights**: The references to other cases concerning the fairness of proceedings and the lack of effective remedies highlight the interconnectedness of detention issues with broader fair trial rights. Future cases may increasingly address the implications of unlawful detention on the right to a fair trial, leading to a more comprehensive approach to human rights violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Potential for Collective Action**: The joinder of multiple applications in this case underscores the importance of collective action in addressing systemic issues of unlawful detention. This may encourage other applicants facing similar violations to unite their claims, potentially leading to more robust findings and remedies from the Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this case could serve as a pivotal reference point for future jurisprudence on unlawful detention, influencing both the interpretation of existing rights under the Convention and the development of new standards for the protection of individual liberties in the context of detention.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI have assessed the potential influence of the case on future jurisprudence regarding unlawful detention. The case reinforces established principles, clarifies jurisdictional issues, broadens the definition of unlawful detention, and may prompt reforms in national legal systems. It also encourages further complaints and emphasizes the interconnectedness of detention issues with fair trial rights.\n",

      "\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mThis case presents a situation that aligns closely with several landmark judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) concerning unlawful detention, particularly under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The Court's findings in this case echo the principles established in previous rulings, reinforcing the importance of lawful detention and adherence to national legal procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Legal Framework and National Law Compliance**: The Court reiterates that the terms \"lawful\" and \"in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\" in Article 5(1) refer back to national law. This principle was established in cases such as **Benham v. the United Kingdom**, where the Court emphasized that a failure to comply with domestic law constitutes a breach of the Convention. The current case similarly underscores the necessity for national authorities to adhere to their own legal standards when detaining individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Precedent of Violations**: The Court references several leading cases, including **Fortalnov and Others v. Russia** and **Butkevich v. Russia**, where it found violations of Article 5 due to unlawful detention practices. These cases involved similar circumstances where the applicants were detained without proper legal justification or procedural safeguards. The current case's findings of a breach of Article 5(1) are consistent with these precedents, indicating a pattern of unlawful detention practices in Russia that the Court has previously condemned.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Admissibility and Merits**: The Court's determination that the complaints are admissible and disclose a breach of Article 5(1) reflects its established approach in cases of unlawful detention. The Court has consistently ruled that if domestic law is not followed, it results in a violation of the Convention. This principle is evident in the current case, where the Court found no compelling arguments to deviate from its established jurisprudence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Other Alleged Violations**: The case also touches upon additional complaints raised by the applicants, which are deemed admissible based on well-established case law. This approach mirrors the Court's handling of similar cases where multiple violations are identified, such as in **Karelin v. Russia** and **Martynyuk v. Russia**, where the Court addressed issues of fairness in proceedings and the lack of effective legal remedies. The current case's acknowledgment of these additional complaints further aligns it with the Court's broader commitment to protecting human rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion and Implications**: The Court's findings in this case reinforce the established jurisprudence regarding unlawful detention, highlighting the necessity for compliance with both domestic and international legal standards. The consistent application of these principles across various cases demonstrates the ECHR's role in safeguarding individual rights against arbitrary state actions. The current case serves as a continuation of the Court's efforts to address systemic issues related to unlawful detention in Russia, contributing to the ongoing dialogue about human rights protections in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this case is emblematic of the ECHR's longstanding commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting individuals from unlawful detention, reflecting the principles established in landmark judgments that have shaped the Court's approach to similar violations.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI have compared this case with similar landmark judgments regarding unlawful detention.

      "\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mThe broader implications of this case for state obligations and human rights practices are significant and multifaceted, particularly in the context of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) jurisprudence. Here are several key points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reinforcement of the Rule of Law**: The Court's findings underscore the importance of adherence to national laws and procedures as a prerequisite for lawful detention. States are reminded that any deprivation of liberty must not only comply with domestic law but also align with the standards set by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This reinforces the principle that the rule of law is fundamental to the protection of human rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Accountability for Violations**: The Court's decision to find violations of Article 5(1) highlights the necessity for states to be held accountable for unlawful detention practices. This serves as a deterrent against arbitrary detention and encourages states to implement legal safeguards to protect individuals from such violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Impact on National Legislation**: The case may prompt states to review and amend their national laws and procedures regarding detention to ensure compliance with ECHR standards. This could lead to reforms aimed at enhancing the protection of individual rights, particularly in the context of administrative detention and the treatment of detainees.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Judicial Independence and Fairness**: The Court's reference to the need for fair proceedings and the presence of a prosecuting party in administrative cases emphasizes the importance of judicial independence and fairness in legal processes. This may encourage states to strengthen their judicial systems and ensure that individuals have access to fair trials and legal representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Protection of Freedom of Expression**: The findings related to interferences with the right to freedom of expression signal to states the necessity of respecting and protecting this fundamental right. States may need to reassess their policies and practices regarding public assemblies, protests, and freedom of speech to avoid disproportionate measures that infringe upon these rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Broader Human Rights Framework**: The case contributes to the evolving interpretation of human rights within the ECHR framework, reinforcing the idea that states have positive obligations to protect individuals from violations. This can lead to a broader understanding of human rights that encompasses not only the prohibition of violations but also the proactive measures states must take to safeguard these rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **International Human Rights Norms**: The Court's decisions serve as a reference point for other jurisdictions and international bodies, potentially influencing global human rights norms and practices. States outside of Europe may look to the ECHR's jurisprudence as a model for their own legal frameworks and human rights protections.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Encouragement for Victims**: The acknowledgment of violations and the potential for compensation under Article 41 of the Convention may empower victims of human rights abuses to seek justice. This can lead to increased reporting of violations and a greater demand for accountability from state authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this case reinforces the obligations of states to uphold human rights standards, particularly regarding lawful detention and the protection of individual freedoms. It serves as a reminder of the importance of legal compliance, judicial fairness, and the protection of fundamental rights, with implications that extend beyond the immediate context of the case to influence broader human rights practices and state obligations.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI have evaluated the broader implications of the case for state obligations and human rights practices. The findings reinforce the rule of law, accountability for violations, and the need for compliance with both national and international legal standards. The case may prompt reforms in national legislation, strengthen judicial independence, and protect fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. It also contributes to the evolving interpretation of human rights within the ECHR framework and encourages victims to seek justice.\n",

      "4. In 2012 the anti-corruption prosecutor s office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice ( the prosecutor s office and the HCCJ ) started a criminal investigation into alleged acts of corruption committed by two senior officials, C and D.

The investigation was widely publicised in the media.\n",
      "5. Between February and August 2015 the applicants, who used to work for C, were interviewed by the prosecutor s office as witnesses in the case. They were believed to have witnessed transactions between C and D which were of interest to the investigation.\n",

      "Prosecutor s order of 28 August 2015\n",
      "6. On 28 August 2015, after interviewing the applicants, the prosecutor s office issued an order declaring them threatened witnesses under the provisions of Articles 125 and 126 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( the CCP , see paragraph 83 below). It was decided that certain protection measures would be taken, namely police surveillance and protection of the applicants home, and a constant police escort. The prosecutor justified the need for protection as follows:\n",
      "On 27 February 2015, 3 March 2015 and 26 August 2015 [A and B] were interviewed as witnesses in connection with the criminal activity which is the subject of criminal case no. ...\n",
      "Witnesses [A and B] are in danger as there is a reasonable suspicion that their life or [physical integrity] may be at risk, bearing in mind the statements they made before the prosecutor s office and which may contribute to establishing the truth and holding the perpetrators criminally responsible.\n",
      "Witnesses [A and B] are in danger as there is a reasonable suspicion that their life or [physical integrity] may be at risk, bearing in mind the statements they made before the prosecutor s office and which may contribute to establishing the truth and holding the perpetrators criminally responsible.\n",
      "7. On the same day the prosecutor s order was sent to the chief of the Directorate General of Police in B. ( the DGP ), who was responsible for ensuring the applicants personal protection, via the Special Actions Service ( the SAS ), and protection of their home, via their local police station. The SAS team started immediately and from February 2016 a second team was assigned to protect the applicants.\n",

      "8. According to the applicants, on 28 August 2015 the prosecutor also drafted, in accordance with the applicable law, an action plan indicating the scope of protection, as well as the measures to be taken and the specific tasks of the police officers in charge of carrying them out. The plan was not provided to the applicants. According to official documents, the plan was an internal DGP document describing specific actions to be taken by the police officers with a view to enforcing the prosecutor s order of 28 August 2015 (see paragraph 6 above). Moreover, as the document contained personal data concerning the police officers involved in the protection scheme, the DGP could not disclose it to the applicants.\n",

They were allegedly told that, if they agreed to be included in the programme, they would be moved to a different town and nobody, not even the case prosecutor, would know their new location. They would have to cut off all contact with their friends and limit contact with their families. They would have to sell all their possessions, as the NOWP could not pay the storage costs during their absence. They were also informed that there was little chance of finding employment in the new location. The applicants asked for time to consider the consequences.\n",

      "13. On 11 February 2016 the DGP asked the prosecutor s office to transfer the applicants protection to the NOWP. The DGP explained that the applicants had refused to cooperate with the teams assigned for their protection, leaving their home unaccompanied and without stating their intentions to the police officers concerned. Moreover, they pointed out that there were currently no DGP regulations in place concerning the methods of protecting threatened witnesses (see paragraph 17 below).\n",
      "14. On 22 February 2016 the NOWP informed the prosecutor that the applicants could not be included in the programme. It explained that an agreement could not be reached with them concerning the scope of protection. For instance, the applicants had asked to be guaranteed a high level of comfort if relocated nationally or internationally, which was an exaggerated request and impossible for the NOWP to ensure.\n",

On 1 March 2016 the applicants were invited to the DGP s premises to sign protection protocols, which were documents including a detailed description of the police officers duties and the applicants obligations (notably to refrain from any action that might compromise the protection measures, inform the police of any changes in their personal lives and activities, and not disclose their protected witness status or the identity of the police officers involved).\n",

      "19. On 29 June 2016 the prosecutor s office asked the HCCJ to lift the measures taken in the applicants favour and exclude them from the witness protection programme, on the grounds that they were no longer in any danger. The prosecutor argued that the applicants could not indicate any specific circumstances confirming the existence of a threat to life and limb. The prosecutor also stated that they had not cooperated with the police officers assigned to protect them and had refused to sign the protection protocols, blocking the procedure. Moreover, the prosecutor argued that any protection inevitably restricted the applicants personal freedom, and as long as they were unwilling to accept that, the protection measures could not be enforced.\n",

      "20. In court, the applicants disagreed with the prosecutor s request and maintained that the threat to life and limb still persisted. They also declared that they accepted the protocols, but did not trust the police officers who had been assigned to protect them. They considered that the latter had committed abuses by refusing to accompany them, while at the same time preventing them from leaving their home unaccompanied.\n",

      "21. On 25 August 2016 the HCCJ dismissed the prosecutor s request of 29 June 2016 (see paragraph 19 above). It considered that the reasons for the initial measures remained valid since the High Court was still hearing evidence in the main proceedings. The HCCJ further considered that it was the authorities fault that it had taken such a long time for the protection protocols to be provided to the applicants. The HCCJ considered that the witness protection should continue within the limits set by the prosecutor in the order of 28 August 2015 (see paragraph 6 above). It noted, however, that the protection protocols were not subject to negotiation and, by their nature, imposed certain limitations on the applicants freedom; those limitations could not, however, amount to a complete denial of their rights.\n",

According to official documents, on 14 October 2016 the applicants were allowed to consult the decision in question.\n",
      "23. On 5 September 2016 the applicants gave the prosecutor s office their consent to be included in the witness protection programme, and reiterated that the protection offered until then under the relevant provisions of the CCP had been deficient, abusive and restrictive of their rights.\n",

According to a police report drafted that day, the applicants, after reading the documents, declared that they would never comply with the requirements issued by the police officers, would never state their intention to leave their home or wait for the police escort before leaving, and would not agree to moving elsewhere on the territory of Romania.\n",

On 26 October 2016 the prosecutor asked the NOWP to assess the feasibility of including the applicants in the witness protection programme, starting the procedure provided for by the Witness Protection Act ( the WPA , see paragraph 85 below). The NOWP assessed the situation in a confidential report.\n",

      "(c) help in securing employment; and\n",
      "(d) financial assistance until employment was found.\n",

      "30. On 17 January 2017 the applicants signed a framework of assistance detailing the protection measures and assistance offered, and the protection protocols. They were mainly required to refrain from any activity which would compromise the protection measures or disclose their status or the identity of the police officers involved. They were also required not to record any of their meetings with the liaison officer. The protocols also reiterated the situations in which the protection programme would end, as described in Article 17 of the WPA (see paragraph 85 below).\n",

The NOWP was of the view that the request could not be met for various reasons; one being that the applicants presence was needed for the purposes of the criminal investigation in which they were witnesses.\n",
      "33. On 30 January 2017 the applicants also requested financial assistance from the NOWP, presenting a detailed account of their expenses and tax obligations. They also sought the NOWP s help in finding employment.\n",
      "34. According to a report by the NOPW of 1 February 2017, the applicants could not be offered employment because they had refused all the offers made by the authorities corresponding to their level of education and had asked to work in fields in which they had not yet obtained professional qualifications. On 1 February and 9 March 2017 the NOWP informed the HCCJ of the attempts to find employment for the applicants and their rejection of all the proposals.\n",

      "35. In an interlocutory judgment of 30 March 2017 the HCCJ dismissed the requests formulated by the applicants. It noted that they had refused all the employment proposals made by the NOWP, and the offer to be relocated in Romania. It further noted that their presence was needed often for the purposes of the criminal investigation. The HCCJ also noted that relocation abroad and a change of identity would be impossible, since the applicants could not cross the State border with a temporary identity card, the only identity document that could be issued under the provisions of the WPA. The decision was confidential and it appears that its contents were only made available to the applicants when the Government s observations were forwarded to them by the Court.\n",

She complained to the National Council for Combatting Discrimination. No information as to the outcome of this complaint was available at the date of the applicants last correspondence with the Court (13 March 2018).\n",

According to official documents issued by the NOWP, the applicants received monthly financial support representing the equivalent of the gross minimum wage, that is to say 1,250 Romanian lei (RON) initially, which was raised to RON 2,080 (approximately 500 euro (EUR)).

According to the applicants, the officers admitted that they had not received any instructions concerning their mission, which they said was the first of its kind. Their usual assignment involved protection of public officials and judges and prosecutors.\n",

      "41. The applicants further noted that instead of guarding their flat, the police officers sometimes slept in their car, drank on duty or even guarded the building next door. They did not carry any weapons to ensure effective protection. They had also left the liaison file unattended in public places (in particular they recounted an incident on 9 February 2016 when the liaison file had been lost). The file included photographs of the applicants, confidential data about the purpose of the protection mission and other sensitive information (see paragraph 67 below).\n",

      "42. The applicants alleged that they were sometimes prevented from leaving their building because their SAS team was not available, or they were simply left without protection. They recounted an incident on 11 February 2016 when B, left without protection because the team was accompanying A, was told to go to the nearest police office to seek help, but once there, had been held against his will for two hours and prevented from leaving on his own.\n",
      "43. The applicants further explained that they were only allowed to travel from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., in SAS cars, and could not leave town. They were not allowed to leave home without observing these limitations, not even if they were willing to forego protection. They were asked to call ahead and wait for the SAS officers to arrive at their home. Because of how the protection measures were being carried out, they had been unable to attend important family events, such as weddings, christenings and funerals.\n",
      "44. The applicants also explained that the SAS officers were conspicuous and carried unconcealed weapons, which often revealed the applicants status to the public. The applicants also noticed that the SAS officers were filming them while travelling. Eventually, the applicants started to feel threatened by the police officers in charge of their protection.\n",
      "The Government s version\n",
      "45. The documents provided by the DGP at the Government s request indicate that the applicants protection was ensured as follows:\n",

      "(b) the applicants protection while travelling was ensured by SAS officers in two twelve-hour shifts.\n",

      "47. B, who was unsatisfied with the manner in which the authorities had organised the protection of him and A, often got into arguments with the police officers. For instance, on 26 October 2016 he was fined 500 Romanian lei (RON, about EUR 110 at the time) for offending a police officer; on 20 November 2016 he was fined RON 500 (about EUR 110 at the time) for not allowing the police officers access to his flat (B explained that the police officers had refused to give their names when they had called on him; the fine was cancelled by the District Court on 19 May 2017); on 27 December 2016 he was fined RON 1,000 (about EUR 220 at the time) for posting an offensive comment about police officers on his social media; and on 11 January 2017 he was fined RON 1,000 (about EUR 220 at that time) for offending a police officer in charge of his protection.\n",
      "48. On 24 March 2016, following a request made by A, the DGP informed the applicants of the scope of the protection ordered by the prosecutor on 28 August 2015 (see paragraph 6 above).

At 7.55 p.m. on 28 July 2016 a police officer went to the applicants home in an attempt to put an end to a fight taking place outside the flat between the applicants and the police team assigned to protect them. In his report to the DGP, the police officer stated that the applicants had complained that the whole thing was a mockery and that they were dissatisfied with everything . The applicants also asked to be relocated to different accommodation with equivalent facilities.\n",

It was also reported that the applicants had asked the police officers to stop following them, verbally abused them and threatened to alert passers-by in order to create panic. The police also maintained that since the protection measures had been instituted, there was nothing to indicate that the applicants would be in any danger.

They warned him that they would use force if he continued to breach the peace and eventually handcuffed him and took him to the police station. B was fined and a police report was drawn up regarding the incident.\n",
      "The police inquiry into the incident revealed that the police officers had acted diligently within the limits of their powers. It was suggested that the prosecutor s office and the HCCJ reassess the possibility of maintaining the protection measures.\n",

      "56. The applicants submitted a letter of 23 May 2017, signed by the director of the NOWP, informing them that they could not be offered genuine protection or help finding employment. The private sector refused to hire them because of their role in the criminal investigation, and the public sector was inaccessible because of C s connections. They were told that anyone included in the witness protection programme was offered the minimum salary in force, irrespective of their personal situation. A total change of identity was impossible because of a lack of harmonisation between the applicable laws. The NOWP advised the applicants against complaining to the courts about the matter, as if they did, they would risk revealing to the public their protected witness status, which would automatically result in exclusion from the protection programme.\n",
      "57. The NOWP admitted that the protection measure that the applicants were benefiting from, namely a surveillance camera installed at the entrance to their home, was ineffective and insufficient. Total relocation should have been considered. The applicants continued to be at risk, and, according to the authorities estimations, would need protection even after the criminal proceedings in question ended.\n",

In the same letter, the NOWP admitted that certain police officers assigned to protect the applicants had posted information about their protected witness status on social media.\n",

They further complained of deficiencies (logistical, technical and in terms of personnel) in their protection. Their complaint was forwarded to the DGP which, on 22 December 2015 took measures to remedy the problems observed during the implementation of the protection measures.\n",

In addition, on 15 February 2016 the police started an investigation against the officer in charge of protecting the applicants home for leaving the post unattended before his replacement arrived and misplacing the liaison file (incident of 9 February 2016). On 12 October 2016 the prosecutor s office attached to the District Court decided not to prosecute. It found that the instructions given to the officers in charge of protecting the applicants home had not been very clear (whether they should guard the flat itself or the building entrance). It also concluded that it had been the applicants who had taken the liaison file without permission.\n",
      "68. On 21 September and 21 October 2016 the SAS informed the applicants that their protection had been ordered under the relevant provisions of the CCP, but that the specific protection measures could only be implemented with their consent. They reminded them that they had on numerous occasions refused to sign the relevant protection protocols and explained that, even without their consent, the authorities were still bound by the prosecutor s order to offer them protection. At the request of the applicants, the same information was given to them by the police section in charge of protecting their home (on 12 October and 12 December 2016), by the DGP (on 4 October and 21 November 2016), and by the anti-corruption prosecutor s office (on 31 October and 5 December 2016).

The letter reiterated that cooperation of the witnesses was essential for the effectiveness of the protection measures.\n",

According to the applicants, the press had not based their articles on an interview with B, and had copied quotes from the Facebook posts made by him.\n",

      "90. The applicants complained about the organisation of the witness protection programme, arguing that it was inefficient. They relied on Articles 2, 8, 13 and 18 of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention. The Court, being master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case (see Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, 114 and 126, 20 March 2018), considers that the nature of this complaint, as well as the manner in which it was formulated, calls for an examination under Article 2 of the Convention alone.\n",

      "91. The Government argued that the applicants had supported their application to the Court using vague and undefined terms, purposely chosen to conceal the factual and legal issues, or manifestly false statements used to fabricate their case. Their intention had been to mislead the Court into believing that they had been subjected to abuse and neglect at the hands of the authorities. For that reason, the Government asked the Court to declare that the applicants had abused their right of application.\n",
      "92. The applicants denied all the accusations brought by the Government concerning their alleged bad faith. They also disputed the allegations that they had fabricated their case. They considered the allegations defamatory, absurd and outrageous. In their view, the Government had misrepresented the situation to justify the failure of the witness protection system and the abuses committed by the authorities. For instance, the lack of evidence as to the risk faced by them was the consequence of a defective investigation by the authorities and not a misrepresentation of the situation by them.\n",
      "The Court s assessment\n",
      "The Court s assessment\n",
      "93. The Court reiterates that under Article 35 3 (a) of the Convention, an application may be rejected as an abuse of the right of individual application if, among other reasons, it was knowingly based on untrue facts. The submission of incomplete and thus misleading information may also amount to an abuse of the right of application, especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation has been provided for the failure to disclose that information. The same applies if important new developments have occurred during the proceedings before the Court and where, despite being expressly required to do so by Rule 47 7 of the Rules of Court, the applicant has failed to disclose that information to the Court, thereby preventing it from ruling on the case in full knowledge of the facts. However, even in such cases, the applicant s intention to mislead the Court must always be established with sufficient certainty (see Gross v. Switzerland [GC], no. 67810/10, 28, ECHR 2014, with further references).\n",
      "94. In the present case, the Court notes that what the Government considered to be abusive behaviour on the part of the applicants (see paragraph 91 above) was no more than a diverging view on the facts of the case and on the effectiveness of the protection granted to the applicants by the domestic authorities. The Court does not discern any inappropriate language in the applicants submissions. Moreover, the Government did not convincingly point to any statements made by the applicants that were clearly false or misleading.\n",
      "95. It follows that the Government s objection of abuse of the right of application should be dismissed.\n",
      "Non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\n",
      "The parties submissions\n",
      "96. The Government contended that the applicants had never complained to the HCCJ about the operational principles guiding implementation of the protection measures, such as the presence of uniformed police officers outside their door or the requirement to state their intention to go somewhere seventy-two hours in advance. They observed that a similar complaint lodged by the applicants concerning relocation abroad had been examined on the merits by the HCCJ in the light of the documents provided by the NOWP (see paragraph 35 above).\n",
      "97. The applicants had not challenged before the courts the prosecutor s decisions not to prosecute in the various complaints brought by them concerning the activity of the police officers assigned to protect them. In the same vein, they argued that A had failed to lodge a complaint with the relevant courts concerning her alleged unlawful dismissal from work (see paragraph 37 above).\n",
      "98. The Government pointed out that the operational guidelines for implementation of the protective measures had only been adopted in February 2014. There had not therefore been sufficient time for a domestic judicial practice to develop in this regard.\n",
      "99. The applicants pointed out that, with only one exception, all the criminal complaints they had lodged had been dismissed by the prosecutor s office. They further averred that the Government could not indicate which domestic actions would have constituted certain, effective and accessible remedies, in theory as well as in practice.\n",
      "100. They asserted that they had had no possibility of bringing before the domestic courts their complaints concerning the manner in which the protection programme had been organised and the gross negligence of the persons entrusted with their protection.\n",
      "The Court s assessment\n",
      "101. The Court refers to the well-established principles of its case-law, as reiterated notably in Gherghina v. Romania ((dec.) [GC], no. 42219/07, 83-89, 9 July 2015), and Vu kovi and Others v. Serbia ((preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, 69-77, 25 March 2014).\n",
      "102. In particular, the Court reiterates that the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires applicants to make normal use of remedies which are available and sufficient in respect of their Convention grievances. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Gherghina, cited above, 85, with further references).\n",

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Gherghina, cited above, 85, with further references).\n",
      "103. Nevertheless, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. However, the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to pursue it (ibid., 86, with further references).\n",
      "104. The Court has, however, also frequently stressed the need to apply the exhaustion rule with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (ibid., 87, with further references).\n",

      "105. The Court also reiterates that as regards the burden of proof, it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. The availability of a remedy said to exist, including its scope and application, must be clearly set out and confirmed or complemented by practice or case-law (ibid., 88, and see Molla Sali v. Greece [GC], no. 20452/14, 89, 19 December 2018).\n",
      "106. At the outset the Court notes that the applicants raised their grievances with the HCCJ, indicating exactly the problems encountered with the protection measures and the police officers involved, and that at least some of those complaints were examined by that court (see, in particular, paragraphs 20, 21 and 35 above).\n",
      "107. They also complained to the police and the prosecutor s office (see, in particular, paragraphs 65-66 above). Admittedly, the applicants did not challenge before the courts the prosecutor s decisions that were unfavourable to them. However, the Court cannot speculate about whether in lodging such actions with the courts other than the HCCJ, which, in their case, was responsible for the protection measures under the WPA (see paragraphs 19 and 28 above, and Article 5 of the WPA cited in paragraph 85 above) the applicants, whose identity was not protected, would have exposed themselves publicly and thus risked breaching their obligation not to disclose their protected witness status. A similar concern was expressed by the director of the NOWP in his letter of 23 May 2017 (see paragraphs 5658 above), although the authenticity of the letter is contested by the Government (see paragraph 59 above). The Court cannot but note that the decisions taken by the HCCJ were confidential and not communicated to the applicants (see paragraphs 22 and 35 above).\n",
      "108. In these circumstances, the Court considers that, by bringing their grievances before the HCCJ, the applicants exhausted the domestic remedies available to them. It follows that the Government s objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies should be dismissed.\n",
      "Other grounds for inadmissibility\n",
      "109. The Court further notes that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n",

The applicants complained that the authorities had not provided them with the appropriate protection, and that the investigations into their various allegations of threats had been ineffective. They pointed out that the authorities had been under an obligation to take operational measures to investigate all risks to their lives and to prevent any risk from materialising. They had instead treated the threats to the applicants lives, such as the slashing of their car tyres or the bullets found on their doorstep (see paragraph 63 above), in a perfunctory manner.\n",

      "111. As to the quality of protection received, the applicants argued that the DGP had never understood the situation of a witness in need of protection or how to implement protection measures without violating the rights of witnesses. The police officers had been inexperienced, and had made detailed reports on the applicants private lives and shared the reports with other authorities. The applicants had written to the institutions they considered to be responsible for this invasion of their privacy, but to no avail.\n",
      "The Government\n",
      "112. The Government pointed out that the allegations of a threat to life and limb, made by the applicants to the prosecutor, had never been substantiated by the evidence gathered. In their view, the applicants had knowingly and deliberately misled the Court in order to create the misrepresentation that despite being in possession of evidence of threats, the authorities had decided not to include them in the witness protection programme. In reality, they had failed to inform the prosecutor s office of the alleged threats they had received while the protection measures had been ongoing.\n",

      "114. They also disputed the applicants claims that the police officers had lacked experience or had refused to protect them. The SAS took part in highrisk police operations and were entrusted, for instance, with the protection of judges and prosecutors who had been subjected to threats. The applicants, on the other hand, had made consistent efforts to elude the protection measures, making false requests for protection and breaching their obligations. For instance, they had provoked incidents with the police, given live interviews on national television (which had then led to the termination of A s work contract), declined adequate job offers and refused to cooperate with the authorities.\n",
      "115. The Government reiterated that the requirements imposed on the applicants during their inclusion in the protection programme had not been disproportionate, and that they had implicitly agreed to comply with them when they had agreed to be included in the protection programme.\n",
      "The Court s assessment\n",
      "General principles\n",
      "116. The Court notes that the first sentence of Article 2 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction. The State s obligation in this regard extends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. Article 2 of the Convention may also imply, in certain well-defined circumstances, a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see R.R. and Others v. Hungary, no. 19400/11, 28, 4 December 2012, and Maiorano and Others v. Italy, no. 28634/06, 103-04, 15 December 2009, with further references).\n",
      "116. The Court notes that the first sentence of Article 2 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction. The State s obligation in this regard extends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. Article 2 of the Convention may also imply, in certain well-defined circumstances, a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see R.R. and Others v. Hungary, no. 19400/11, 28, 4 December 2012, and Maiorano and Others v. Italy, no. 28634/06, 103-04, 15 December 2009, with further references).\n",
      "117. Such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. In the opinion of the Court, where there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obligation to protect the right to life in the context of their above-mentioned duty to prevent and suppress offences against the person, it must be established to its satisfaction that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. For the Court, and having regard to the nature of the right protected by Article 2, a right fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge. This is a question which can only be answered in the light of all the circumstances of any particular case (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, 115-16, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).\n",
      "118. So far, the Court has dealt with various situations engaging the States positive obligations to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention from the criminal acts of a third party. It has thus, by applying the test set out in Osman (cited above), defined the scope of the obligation to protect witnesses, notably in R.R. and Others v. Hungary (cited above), which concerned exclusion from the witness protection scheme.\n",
      "119. The Court further notes that Article 2 of the Convention may come into play even though the person whose right to life was allegedly breached did not die. In R.R. and Others v. Hungary (cited above, 2632), the Court considered that the removal of four of the five applicants from the witness protection scheme in Hungary had constituted a breach of the State s positive obligation to protect their right to life, even though they did not lose their lives, since there had been a real and immediate risk (known to the national authorities) to the lives of those individuals, necessitating protection within the witness protection scheme. Noting the Government s failure to show in a persuasive manner that the risk in question had ceased to exist and the inadequacy of the measures taken to protect the applicants lives subsequent to their removal from the witness protection scheme, the Court concluded that the Hungarian authorities actions had fallen short of the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention (see also Selahattin Demirta v. Turkey, no. 15028/09, 3031, 23 June 2015, with further references).\n",
      "Application of those principles to the facts of the present case\n",
      "120. At the outset the Court notes that on 28 August 2015 the applicants were declared threatened witnesses , following statements they had made to the prosecutor s office in a corruption case involving senior officials; in particular, the prosecutor s office believed that the applicants were in danger as there [was] a reasonable suspicion that their life or [physical integrity might] be at risk (see paragraphs 5 and 6 above). On 9 December 2015 the applicants agreed to be included in the witness protection programme (see paragraph 12 above). Several incidents, described as threats to life and limb, were subsequently reported by the applicants, albeit in rather vague terms (see paragraphs 60-64 above). Moreover, despite attempts by the authorities to remove the applicants from the witness protection programme, the HCCJ maintained the measure (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above).\n",
      "121. The Court considers that in applying the rules of witness protection to the applicants case, the authorities explicitly and/or implicitly accepted that there was a risk to their life, physical integrity or personal liberty within the meaning of the relevant legal provisions (see paragraphs 83 and 85 above, and, mutatis mutandis, R.R. and Others v. Hungary, cited above, 30). In this context the Court accepts that there was indeed a serious threat of real and immediate risk to the applicants life, physical integrity and liberty, both when the measure was originally put in place and when the applicants left Romania in October 2017 (see paragraph 80 above).\n",
      "122. Having established that at that time the authorities knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate risk to the applicants life, it remains to be established whether they did all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid it (see the case-law cited in paragraph 117 above).\n",
      "123. The Court notes that the authorities placed the applicants under protection as soon as a risk was identified (see paragraph 6 above). The parties disagree as to the nature of the initial protection order, the applicants arguing that it was meant to be a temporary measure and the Government pointing to the different nature of the two protection schemes (see, respectively, paragraphs 10 and 113 above). Be that as it may, it is to be noted that, in practice, that order gave rise to a series of measures being taken to protect the applicants: an action plan was adopted the same day (see paragraph 8 above), the parties concerned entered into negotiations to set the details of that protection (see paragraphs 7-11 above), and two teams were assigned to protect the applicants (see paragraph 7 in fine above).\n",
      "124. Admittedly, it took the authorities six months to draft the protection protocols: from 28 August 2015, when the prosecutor s order was adopted (see paragraph 6 above) to 1 March 2016, when the protocols were first provided to the applicants (see paragraph 15 above). However, that delay was not left unaddressed, as the HCCJ criticised the authorities for their inaction (see paragraph 21 above). The Court also notes that it took the authorities more than three months to secure, on 9 December 2015, the applicants consent to be included in the protection programme (see paragraph 12 above).\n",
      "125. Furthermore, the prosecutor waited until 26 October 2016 to start the proper procedure for including the applicants in the witness protection programme under the WPA (see paragraph 26 above). Two months passed between the date of the HCCJ s decision of 25 August 2016 (see paragraph 21 above) and the date on which the prosecutor made that request.\n",
      "126. The Court is concerned that a matter of such importance and urgency was left unresolved by the authorities for such long periods of time, amounting to a total of more than one year and four months, from 28 August 2015, when the risk was first identified (see paragraph 6 above), to 17 January 2017, when the applicants were formally included in the programme (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above).\n",
      "127. That said, the applicants were not left without protection during this time, even if that protection was at least in the beginning mostly improvised, in the absence of regulations, which only became applicable on 1 July 2016 (see paragraphs 13, 17 and 46 above). The inevitable deficiencies were, however, corrected by the authorities (see paragraphs 5658 and 60 in fine above). Moreover, no direct attack against the applicants took place during this time.\n",
      "128. The Court observes that the applicants complained of inexperience and a lack of preparation on the part of the police officers assigned to protect them (see paragraphs 40 and 111 above). However, it cannot but note that, according to the information provided by the Government (see, in particular, paragraph 114 above), the officers had received comparable, highrisk assignments in the past; their experience in the field cannot therefore be disputed.\n",
      "129. Admittedly, the police officers past experience cannot make up for the absence of clear instructions from their superiors concerning the scope and aim of the mission in question. The Court cannot but note that several incidents point to a lack of adequate preparation on the part of the police officers on duty. They were sometimes found to be unarmed or without uniforms, had left the post before the next team arrived, had failed to report, or had simply lost the liaison file which contained sensitive data concerning the applicants (see paragraph 66 above). These omissions risked compromising the applicants protection. However, they were taken seriously by the authorities, who investigated and when necessary reprimanded those responsible (see paragraphs 65 to 67 above).\n",
      "130. Notwithstanding the authorities prompt response to correct the failures identified, the Court accepts that they must have contributed to the escalation of the conflicts and mistrust between the applicants and the police (see, in particular, paragraphs 20 and 111 above). They do not, however, justify the applicants provocative behaviour and repeated disregard of their own responsibilities towards their protection.\n",
      "130. Notwithstanding the authorities prompt response to correct the failures identified, the Court accepts that they must have contributed to the escalation of the conflicts and mistrust between the applicants and the police (see, in particular, paragraphs 20 and 111 above). They do not, however, justify the applicants provocative behaviour and repeated disregard of their own responsibilities towards their protection.\n",
      "131. In this connection the Court notes that domestic law imposes on protected witnesses a duty to cooperate with the authorities and to abstain from any action that might compromise the safety of the mission. Those duties were clearly set out in the protection protocols to which the applicants eventually gave their consent (see paragraphs 15 and 30 above). Failure to comply with the obligations undertaken by signing the protocols would result in exclusion from the programme (see, in particular, Article 17 of the WPA, cited in paragraph 85 above). It can therefore be accepted that the applicants were fully aware of their duty to cooperate with the authorities.\n",
      "132. However, in practice, the applicants repeatedly failed to comply with their obligations and breached the protection protocols. They were uncooperative and very often exhibited inappropriate behaviour towards the police officers. They made considerable efforts to elude the protection measures and obstruct the work of the officers assigned to protect them (see notably the incidents described in paragraphs 52-55 above). They refused to cooperate with the protection teams (see, for instance, paragraphs 47 and 50 above) and used offensive language towards the police (see, for instance, paragraph 54 above). The applicants also allegedly made unattainable demands to the authorities concerning the obligation to find them new jobs and refused to compromise (see paragraphs 32-35 above). Moreover, the applicants, through their presence on social media and on television (see paragraphs 69-77 above), risked compromising their protected witness status.\n",
      "133. Furthermore, the applicants refused the offer of relocation within Romania (see paragraph 24 above). As to their request to have their identities changed and to be relocated abroad (see paragraph 32 above), the HCCJ dismissed them after careful examination and provided reasons as to why those measures would not be feasible in their situation (see paragraph 35 above). In complete disregard of the HCCJ s decision and of their obligation to comply with the protection protocols, the applicants decided unilaterally to relocate abroad. This act effectively ended their protection (see paragraphs 30 and 85 above) and potentially exposed their lives and physical integrity to serious risk. It appears, however, that despite the additional difficulties raised by this new situation created by the applicants actions, the authorities did not withdraw protection but maintained contact with them abroad (see paragraph 82 above) and continued to offer them financial support (see paragraph 39 above).\n",
      "134. The Court commends the authorities for their efforts to continue the protection despite the applicants lack of cooperation instead of withdrawing them from the witness protection programme, an option provided for by law (see Article 17 of the WPA, cited in paragraph 85 above, and paragraph 131 above). Their willingness to ensure the protection of the applicants and to find alternative solutions did not weaken despite the applicants lack of cooperation, breach of the rules and provocative behaviour.\n",
      "134.

      "135. In the light of the above findings, the Court considers that the authorities did what could reasonably be expected of them to protect the applicants from the alleged risk to their lives. They thus complied with the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention.\n",

The case involves issues of witness protection, personal security, privacy, and freedom of movement, among others. Below is a structured analysis mapping these principles to relevant ECHR Articles:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Legal Principles and ECHR Articles\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Right to Life (Article 2)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: The State has a positive obligation to protect the life of individuals within its jurisdiction, especially when there is a known risk to life.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The applicants were declared threatened witnesses, indicating a reasonable suspicion that their lives were at risk due to their involvement in a high-profile corruption case. The State's duty to protect them is engaged under Article 2.\n",
      "   - **Conflict/Balance**: The effectiveness of the protection measures and the adequacy of the State's response to the threats are central to assessing compliance with Article 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prohibition of Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (Article 3)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: The State must ensure that individuals are not subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The applicants alleged deficiencies in the protection measures, including inadequate instructions to police officers and failure to identify potential threats. These allegations could potentially engage Article 3 if the treatment reached a certain severity.\n",
      "   - **Conflict/Balance**: The balance between providing effective protection and ensuring that the measures do not themselves become oppressive or degrading.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Right to Respect for Private and Family Life (Article 8)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Individuals have the right to respect for their private and family life, home, and correspondence.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The protection measures, including police surveillance and restrictions on movement, significantly impacted the applicants' private and family life. The refusal to disclose the protection plan and the imposition of certain protocols also raise Article 8 concerns.\n",
      "   - **Conflict/Balance**: The need to protect the applicants must be balanced against their right to privacy and autonomy. The measures should be proportionate and necessary in a democratic society.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Right to Liberty and Security (Article 5)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Individuals have the right to liberty and security, and any deprivation of liberty must be lawful and justified.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The applicants were allegedly prevented from leaving their home unaccompanied and faced restrictions on their movement, which could engage Article 5 if these amounted to a deprivation of liberty.\n",
      "   - **Conflict/Balance**: The necessity and proportionality of the restrictions imposed for the purpose of protection must be assessed against the applicants' right to liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Freedom of Expression (Article 10)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Individuals have the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to receive and impart information.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The applicants' use of social media to express dissatisfaction with the protection measures and their public appearances raise issues under Article 10.\n",
      "   - **Conflict/Balance**: The State's interest in maintaining the confidentiality and effectiveness of the witness protection program must be balanced against the applicants' right to freedom of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Right to an Effective Remedy (Article 13)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Individuals have the right to an effective remedy before a national authority for violations of their rights under the Convention.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The applicants lodged numerous complaints about the protection measures and alleged abuses, which were largely dismissed. The effectiveness of these remedies is in question.\n",
      "   - **Conflict/Balance**: The adequacy of the legal avenues available to the applicants to challenge the protection measures and seek redress for alleged violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The case involves a complex interplay of ECHR rights, requiring a careful balancing of the State's duty to protect individuals at risk with the need to respect their fundamental rights and freedoms. The effectiveness, proportionality, and necessity of the protection measures are central to determining compliance with the Convention.

These citations highlight the established principles regarding the state's obligations to protect individuals, particularly in the context of witness protection and the right to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I will assess the potential influence of this case on future jurisprudence and its contribution to the development of ECHR law. This will involve evaluating the case's precedential impact, its novelty, and its broader implications for human rights practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assessment of Potential Influence and Contribution\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Precedential Impact**\n",
      "   - The case builds upon established ECHR jurisprudence regarding the protection of witnesses and the state's obligations under Article 2. By applying principles from cases like *Radomilja and Others v. Croatia* and *R.R. and Others v. Hungary*, the Court reinforces the necessity for states to implement effective witness protection measures.\n",
      "   - The Court's analysis of the adequacy of the protection measures and the balance between state obligations and individual rights may serve as a reference point for future cases involving witness protection and the right to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Novelty**\n",
      "   - While the case does not introduce entirely new legal principles, it clarifies the application of existing principles in the context of witness protection. The emphasis on the state's positive obligations under Article 2, particularly in light of the applicants' specific circumstances, adds depth to the understanding of these obligations.\n",
      "   - The case also highlights the importance of cooperation between protected witnesses and authorities, which may influence how future cases are approached regarding the responsibilities of both parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Broader Implications**\n",
      "   - The case has significant implications for the implementation of witness protection programs across ECHR member states. It underscores the need for clear guidelines and effective measures to ensure the safety of witnesses, particularly in high-stakes cases involving corruption or organized crime.\n",
      "   - The Court's findings may prompt states to reevaluate their witness protection frameworks, ensuring they are not only compliant with ECHR standards but also effective in practice. This could lead to reforms aimed at enhancing the protection of vulnerable individuals involved in legal proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Impact on Human Rights Practices**\n",
      "   - The case serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between state security measures and individual rights. It emphasizes the need for states to respect the privacy and autonomy of individuals while fulfilling their protective obligations.\n",
      "   - The Court's decision may encourage greater scrutiny of witness protection practices, fostering a culture of accountability and transparency in how states handle the safety of witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Based on the analysis of the case facts, law, legal principles, and citations, I conclude that this case is a **KEY CASE** in ECHR jurisprudence. It makes a significant contribution to the development and clarification of legal principles regarding the state's obligations to protect individuals at risk, particularly in the context of witness protection. The case not only reinforces existing jurisprudence but also provides valuable insights into the practical implications of these obligations, potentially influencing future legal practices and reforms across member states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The case is classified as a **KEY CASE** due to its significant contribution to the development of ECHR jurisprudence regarding witness protection and the state's obligations under Article 2. It clarifies existing principles and emphasizes the need for effective measures to safeguard individuals at risk, with broader implications for human rights practices.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mIn analyzing the case facts provided, several key legal principles emerge, particularly concerning the balance between freedom of expression and the protection of religious beliefs. These principles are primarily related to Articles 9 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Below is a structured analysis mapping these principles to the relevant ECHR Articles:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Legal Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Freedom of Expression (Article 10 ECHR)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 10 protects the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The applicant argued that her statements were protected under Article 10, as they were expressions of opinion and criticism of religious practices, which are permissible even if they offend, shock, or disturb.\n",
      "   - **Balancing**: The courts had to balance this right against the need to protect the rights of others, particularly the right to freedom of religion under Article 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Freedom of Religion (Article 9 ECHR)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 9 protects the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, including the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The courts considered whether the applicant's statements constituted an abusive attack on the Prophet Muhammad, which could infringe on the religious rights of Muslims.\n",
      "   - **Balancing**: The courts emphasized that while freedom of religion does not shield religious beliefs from criticism, the manner of criticism should not be gratuitously offensive or incite hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Protection Against Hate Speech and Incitement (Article 17 ECHR)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Article 17 prohibits the abuse of rights, ensuring that the rights enshrined in the Convention are not used to destroy or limit the rights of others.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The courts examined whether the applicant's statements were intended to incite hatred or were merely provocative. The distinction was crucial in determining whether her expression was protected or constituted an abuse of rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Necessity and Proportionality (Article 10(2) ECHR)**\n",
      "   - **Principle**: Any restriction on freedom of expression must be prescribed by law, pursue a legitimate aim, and be necessary in a democratic society.\n",
      "   - **Application**: The courts found that the interference with the applicant's freedom of expression was justified to protect religious peace and the rights of others, and that the penalty imposed was proportionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conflicts and Balancing Between Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Conflict**: The primary conflict in this case was between the applicant's right to freedom of expression (Article 10) and the protection of religious beliefs and peace (Article 9). The applicant's statements were seen as potentially inciting religious hatred, which necessitated a careful balancing act.\n",
      "- **Balancing**: The courts conducted a balancing exercise to determine whether the applicant's statements were a legitimate exercise of free speech or an abusive attack on religious beliefs. The courts concluded that the statements exceeded permissible limits of criticism and were capable of arousing justified indignation, thus justifying the restriction on her freedom of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The case illustrates the complex interplay between freedom of expression and the protection of religious beliefs within the framework of the ECHR. The courts emphasized the importance of context and intent in determining whether expressions are protected or constitute an abuse of rights. The decision reflects the necessity of balancing individual rights with the broader need to maintain religious peace and respect in a democratic society.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: I have identified the key legal principles involved in the case, which revolve around the balance between freedom of expression and the protection of religious beliefs, primarily under Articles 9 and 10 of the ECHR.

      "- **Novel Applications:** The case highlights the importance of context, such as public seminars, in determining the impact of statements on religious peace and the justification for interference with freedom of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis provides a framework for understanding how the ECHR might approach the case based on hypothetical precedents. If you have specific cases in mind, please provide them for a more precise analysis.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: I have gathered the necessary information about the legal principles involved and how the case uses previous ECHR jurisprudence.

      "\n",
      "The case involves the balance between freedom of expression and the protection of religious beliefs, primarily under Articles 9 and 10 of the ECHR. The cited precedents, such as Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria and İ.A. v. Turkey, are used to support existing principles regarding the limits of freedom of expression when it conflicts with religious sentiments. The case applies established principles and extends them by examining the context and intent behind the applicant's statements, focusing on whether they were intended to contribute to public debate or to defame religious figures.\n",

      "   - **Balancing/Conflict:** The principle of effective investigation under Article 2 may conflict with procedural issues such as statutes of limitations and res judicata, as seen in the initial closure of the investigation due to the statute of limitations and the Supreme Court's prior decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Right to an Effective Remedy (Article 13 of the ECHR):**\n",
      "   - **Principle:** Article 13 guarantees the right to an effective remedy for violations of rights and freedoms under the Convention.\n",
      "   - **Application:** The applicant sought justice for her son's death through domestic legal avenues. The annulment of the decision to close the investigation and the subsequent reopening of the case indicate efforts to provide an effective remedy. However, the prolonged nature of the investigation raises concerns about the effectiveness and timeliness of the remedy.\n",
      "   - **Balancing/Conflict:** The effectiveness of the remedy may be compromised by procedural delays and the complexity of the case, which involves high-profile political figures and historical events.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prohibition of Retroactive Criminal Law (Article 7 of the ECHR):**\n",
      "   - **Principle:** Article 7 prohibits the retroactive application of criminal law, ensuring that no one is held guilty of a criminal offense that was not an offense at the time it was committed.\n",
      "   - **Application:** The reopening of the investigation for crimes against humanity must consider whether the legal framework at the time of the events allowed for such charges. The principle ensures that any prosecution aligns with the legal standards in place during the events of December 1989.\n",
      "   - **Balancing/Conflict:** The need to address serious human rights violations may conflict with the principle of non-retroactivity, particularly if the legal characterization of the acts has evolved since the time of the events.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Right to a Fair Trial (Article 6 of the ECHR):**\n",
      "   - **Principle:** Article 6 ensures the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal.\n",
      "   - **Application:** The applicant's pursuit of justice through the Romanian legal system engages Article 6, particularly concerning the reasonableness of the time taken for the investigation and any subsequent trial. The ongoing nature of the investigation since 1990 raises issues under this Article.\n",
      "   - **Balancing/Conflict:** The complexity and historical significance of the case may justify some delays, but the state must ensure that proceedings do not become excessively protracted, thereby undermining the right to a fair trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "The case involves a complex interplay of ECHR principles, primarily focusing on the state's obligations under Articles 2 and 13 to investigate and provide remedies for the death of the applicant's son. The procedural history highlights challenges in balancing these obligations with procedural safeguards under Articles 6 and 7. The ongoing nature of the investigation underscores the need for the state to fulfill its duties effectively and promptly, ensuring justice for the applicant while respecting the rights of all parties involved.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe case involves the application of established ECHR principles, particularly concerning the right to life (Article 2) and the need for effective investigations into state violence.
