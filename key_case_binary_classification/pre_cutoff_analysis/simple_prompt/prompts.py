Instruction:
You are a highly skilled legal analyst tasked with classifying legal cases into two categories based on their facts section:

    - Key Case: A case with substantial legal importance, such as setting a significant precedent, resolving major legal ambiguities, or influencing future cases.
    - Non-Key Case: A case that deals with routine matters, applies established principles, or lacks broader legal implications.

Follow these steps to ensure accurate classification:

    - Understand the Facts: Identify the essential details, focusing on the legal issues and outcomes.
    - Assess Significance: Consider whether the case introduces new interpretations, resolves conflicts, or sets a precedent.
    - Contextualize: Compare the case's significance against common legal benchmarks for precedent and broader impact.
    - Justify Classification: Provide a clear, step-by-step rationale for your decision.
    - Self-Check: Reevaluate the classification by reviewing the facts and reasoning for consistency.

Examples for Guidance:

Example 1:

Facts:
A Supreme Court case resolves a longstanding conflict between state and federal regulations regarding environmental protection. The ruling creates a new standard for federal preemption and influences future cases nationwide.

Reasoning:

    The case resolves a critical legal conflict (state vs. federal regulations).
    It establishes a new standard, setting a significant precedent.
    The decision has implications beyond the immediate dispute, affecting future cases nationwide.

Classification: Key Case.

Example 2:

Facts:
A local court case dismisses a claim because it lacks sufficient evidence to proceed to trial. The ruling applies well-established evidentiary standards without introducing new interpretations.

Reasoning:

    The case applies existing legal principles (evidentiary standards).
    It does not introduce new interpretations or broader legal implications.
    The outcome is routine and lacks precedent-setting value.

Classification: Non-Key Case.

Case for Classification:

Facts:
{case_facts}

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

    Understand the Facts: What are the key issues, outcomes, and legal principles involved?
    Assess Significance: Does the case resolve ambiguities, set new precedents, or influence future cases?
    Contextualize: Compare its significance to typical key cases.
    Justify Classification: Explain your decision step by step.
    Self-Check: Reassess the reasoning and ensure alignment with the classification criteria.

You are a legal analyst specializing in European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) jurisprudence tasked with determining whether a legal case is a key case or a non-key case based on its facts.

A Key Case is one that:
    - Resolves significant legal ambiguities.
    - Sets a new legal precedent.
    - Has a broad impact on future cases or legal principles.

A Non-Key Case is one that:
    - Applies existing principles without introducing new interpretations.
    - Addresses routine or procedural matters.
    - Lacks broader implications for the legal system.

Task:
Based on the facts provided, classify the case as either a Key Case or a Non-Key Case. Your decision should be based strictly on the criteria above.
