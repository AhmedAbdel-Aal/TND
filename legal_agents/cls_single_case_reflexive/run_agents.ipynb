The Federal Court dismissed his appeal, ruling that the provision was not unconstitutional, and the application was inadmissible. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later declared the application admissible, finding a violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention, as the applicant suffered discriminatory treatment compared to widows.

The legal principles established in the case set a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations, which has a ripple effect on the development of human rights law and policies in Ukraine and beyond.\\n* Application: The case applies existing principles of human rights law, but also introduces new interpretations and clarifications, particularly in regards to the necessity of statutory warrants or authorizations for detentions and the importance of effective investigations and accountability.\\n* Contribution: The case makes a significant contribution to the development of the ECHR's case-law, particularly in the areas of the right to liberty and security, the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment, and compensation for damages. It sets a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations and reinforces the importance of effective investigations, accountability, and compensation.\\n\\nTaking into account the expert suggestions, I provide more specific examples of the case's contribution to the development of human rights law, such as:\\n\\n* The case clarifies the obligations of States to respect and protect the right to liberty and security, particularly in regards to the necessity of statutory warrants or authorizations for detentions.\\n* The case establishes new legal principles regarding the importance of effective investigations and accountability in cases of human rights violations.\\n* The case provides a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations, which has a significant impact on the development of human rights law and policies in Ukraine and beyond.\\n\\nMoreover, I break down the importance of the case into more specific categories, such as:\\n\\n* Importance for the right to liberty and security: High (Clarification of the obligations of States to respect and protect this right)\\n* Importance for the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment: High (Establishment of new legal principles regarding the importance of effective investigations and accountability in cases of human rights violations)\\n* Importance for compensation for damages: Medium (Clarification of the obligation to provide adequate, effective, and prompt compensation for harm caused by human rights violations)\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the case may not introduce entirely new legal principles, its significance lies in clarifying and reinforcing existing principles, as well as providing a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations. Therefore, I reclassify the importance class of the case of Medvedyev and others v. Ukraine as High.\""

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) finds that both applications disclose a breach of Article 6(1) and Article 13 of the Convention due to excessive length of criminal proceedings and lack of effective domestic remedies. Specifically, the prolonged duration of criminal proceedings and the absence of adequate mechanisms to address these issues in domestic law resulted in a violation of the applicants' rights. The respondent State is ordered to pay the applicants within three months the amounts specified in the appended table, converted into the currency of the respondent State at the applicable rate.

      "In accordance with Article 45 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 2 of the Rules of Court, the concurring opinion of Mrs Tulkens is annexed to this judgment.\n",
      "In this particularly sensitive and delicate case, I should simply like to make a few additional observations.\n",
      "1. I consider that it was important and significant that the Court should examine the case under both Article 3 and Article 8 of the Convention. Rape infringes not only the right to personal integrity (both physical and psychological) as guaranteed by Article 3, but also the right to autonomy as a component of the right to respect for private life as guaranteed by Article 8.\n",
      "2. I agree entirely with the Court's general approach (see paragraphs 148 et seq. of the judgment) and the manner in which it was applied in the present case (see paragraphs 169 et seq.). The only point I wish to clarify concerns the use of criminal remedies. Relying, in particular, on X and Y v. the Netherlands (judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91), the Court considers that States have a positive obligation inherent in Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention to enact criminal-law provisions effectively punishing rape (see paragraph 153). Admittedly, recourse to the criminal law may be understandable where offences of this kind are concerned. However, it is also important to emphasise on a more general level, as, indeed, the Court did in X and Y v. the Netherlands itself, that [r]ecourse to the criminal law is not necessarily the only answer (p. 12, 24 in fine). I consider that criminal proceedings should remain, both in theory and in practice, a last resort or subsidiary remedy and that their use, even in the context of positive obligations, calls for a certain degree of restraint . As to the assumption that criminal remedies are, in any event, the most effective in terms of deterrence, the observations set out in the Report on Decriminalisation by the European Committee on Crime Problems clearly show that the effectiveness of general deterrence based on the criminal law depends on various factors and that such an approach is not the only way of preventing undesirable behaviour .\n",
      "3. That said, in the present case, as in X and Y v. the Netherlands (p. 13, 27), once the State has opted for a system of protection based on the criminal law, it is of course essential that the relevant criminal-law provisions are fully and rigorously applied in order to provide the applicant with practical and effective protection. In that connection, the Court's observation that [t]he investigation and its conclusion must be centred on the issue of non-consent (see paragraph 181 of the present judgment) is, in my opinion, of fundamental importance.\n",

      "3. **Article 13 of the Convention**: The right to an effective remedy in domestic law is applicable in cases where there is a breach of Article 6-1 (reasonable time requirement).\n",
      "4. **The concept of \"excessive length\"**: In assessing the reasonableness of the length of proceedings, the Court considers whether the overall length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement.\n",
